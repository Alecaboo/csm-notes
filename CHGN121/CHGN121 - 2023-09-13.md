quickest clicker questions known to man

- memorizing polyatomic ions, again, hip hip
	- (table 3.4 in 3.5)


### notes ig
#### Ionic Compounds
- ionic compounds have a super strong bond
- Mostly solids at room temperature
- High melting and boiling points
- Only conductive as a liquid - not as a solid
- Soluble as shit 
	- (in water, or other polar compounds)
	- ch5 is solubility (yipeee)
#### Covalent Compounds
- Can be damn near whatever at room temperature
- Relatively low boiling & melting points
- Basically no conductivity, ever
- Solubility can vary
#### Metals
- Solid at room temperature
	- (mercury is quirked up)
- Conductive as a solid
- High melting & boiling points
- Malleable, ductile 
- Effectively insoluble
	- I mean, you can toss metals in other metals to make alloys, but we don't talk tooooo much about that
- 

## IMFS
- We say that ionic compounds do not have IMFs (Van der Waals is angry ahh hell)
- For intramolecular bond breaking, it's a physical change
	- Much less energy to break compared to intramolecular bonds
- Solids have strong IMFs
	- Liquids are strong....ish, not as strong as solids
	- Gas is weak as shit. Losers. Hit the gym. (Weak to no IMFs)
- Ionic compounds have a lattice structure, only intramolecular forces 
	- That doesn't feel right.
- Covalent compounds have discrete units, which have IMFs 
- Metals have a lattice structure, only intramolecular forces

## Quick Examples
### Structural Formulas
```smiles
C=O
```

They're the shape

### Molecular Formulas
Exact # of atoms in one unit (ie, CH<sub>2</sub>O)

### Empirical Formulas
- Type of atoms in lowest whole # ratio

## Ionic vs Molecular
- Ionic compounds are already in their empirical formulas (neat)
- Empirical formulas exist for molecular ocmpounds (ie, Glucose, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>)


good god someone is going to ask some stupid questions about empirical formulas


## Quick calc examples
- Mass of C = 1\*12 = 12g
- Mass of H = 2\*1 = 2g
- Mass of O = 1\*16 = 16g
- Grand total of ~30g
	- % carbon is 40.00%
	- %H = 6.7%
	- %O = 53.28%
