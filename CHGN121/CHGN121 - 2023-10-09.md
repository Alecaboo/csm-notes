### clicker questions
1. C, they're all strong electrolytes
2. C, did the math and it was mathing
3. A, 0.839 g with AgC<sub>2</sub> blah blah blah as the limiting


## notes probably
### redox (combustion) time
- If we were to start with neutral free elements and becomes ions
	- Losing an electron causing oxidation
	- Gaining an electron is reduction
- Redox needs to happen together, anything that undergoes oxidation is a reducing agent - it causes something else to gain an electron
	- anything that undergoes reduction is an oxidizing agent, causing something else to lose an electron
- Couple mnemonics
		- LEO says GER
		- Oxidation is loss, Reduction is Gain - OIL RIG
- Oxidation number = charge assigned to most electronegative ion
	- Oxygen is usually -2, peroxide is -1
	- Fluorine is -1, most halogens are also -1, unless they're kicking it with oxygen, in which case they would be positive in order to balance charges 
	- Sum on a neutral molecule must be neutral! wow!!!!
	- Sum on a polyatomic ion must equal the charge on the ion!!! shocking!!!
