- Francium is fat
- Each electron in anything other than hydrogen is attracted to the nucleus and repulsed by other electrons
	- Atomic radius is how effectively they shove each other around
- We use coulomb's law to do this$\frac{kq1q2}{r^{2}}$ 
	- q is charge, r is distance between charges
		- Protons and electrons have the same charge, so that's neat
		- Repulsive force if charges match (+ +, - - ), attractive if they don't (negative sign in front of the force) 
	- That and effective nuclear charge, which is another trip
- We're going to break that up to look at penetration and shielding effect
	- From there we can look at trends n shit, like atomic radius, ionization energy, electron affinity, and electronegativity
		- Francium is fat
		- Fluorine is electronegative
- Shielding causes electrons to have reduced electrons to the nucleus
	- Number of core electrons influence how close outer electrons can get to the nucleus
		- Ex: for every core electron, neutralize a nuclear charge (proton in nucleus)
	- Neon has less shielding than oxygen
	- Nucleus has a greater grip on valence electrons as we go left to right
- Penetration is how close an electron can get ot eh nucleus
	- Based on energy level and orbital
- Orbitals witht he same shell number are not degenerate, because some of them can get closer to the nucleus
	- So like, 4s<sup>2</sup> and 4p<sup>6</sup> aren't degenerate, because 4s<sup>2</sup> can get closer to the nucleus
