- remember to actually do activity 12 that you walked out of class for
- Maybe go loot activities from Coolbaugh 114
- NH<sub>4</sub>OH + FeCl<sub>3</sub> -> blah blah i got the clicker

## notes
- Molecular equation is all the molecules stuck together, complete *ionic* is everything that's soluble in ion form

So we'd have something like 2Na+ + SO<sub>4</sub>2-  + Pb2+ + 2NO<sub>3</sub> -> 2Na+ + 2NO<sub>3</sub>- + PbSO<sub>4</sub>

What we actually care about is the net ionic equation, so we gotta get rid of the stuff that hangs around like a bunch of loafers on both sides

SO<sub>4</sub>2- + Pb2+ + -> PbSO<sub>4</sub>

- Spectator ions are hanging out from electrostatic boredom

- When no precipitate is formed, if you were to draw the complete ionic equation, you would get
- {nothing} -> {nothing}

### acid base time
- if we makin water, we cookin
- acids are going to be covalent a bunch of the time, and they're going to dissolve and ionize in water (yippee)
#### acids
- Arrhenius Acid: substance that dissolves in water and produces H+ or H<sub>3</sub>O+ (protons or hydronium)
	- For example, if we were to dissolve HCl and make H+ and Cl- 
		- we're actually making H<sub>3</sub>O+ and Cl- 
	- obligatory reminder that arrhenius acid is cringe
- Bronsted-Lowry Acid: substances that donates H+ ions to ANY substance
	- as long as we're giving hydrogen to somebody, we don't give a shit if it's happening with water or whatever else
- HCl + NH<sub>3</sub> -> NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> + Cl<sup>-</sup> 
### bases
- Arrhenius Base: substance that when dissolved produces hydroxide ions (OH<sup>-</sup>)
	- NaOH ->  Na<sup>+</sup> + OH<sup>-</sup>
	- H<sub>2</sub>O + NH<sub>3</sub> <-> NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> + OH<sup>-</sup>
		- we're expected to know that ammonia is a base
			- Neat? ig?
	- Ammonia or any amines are Arrhenius bases
- Bronsted-Lowry Base: substance that accepts H+ ions from any substance to form hydroxides
- HCl + NH<sub>3</sub> <-> NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> + Cl<sup>-</sup>

Acidic means we have more hydroniums (H<sub>3</sub>O) than hydroxides (OH<sup>-</sup>) 
Basic means we have more hydroxides than hydroniums 

Important notation:
- Single arrow
	- 100% ionization
	- No reactant, only products
	- Strong electrolytes (acids, bases, or salts)
- Double arrow
	- Partial ionization
	- Mixture of reactant and product
	- Weak electrolyte (acid, base, salt)
