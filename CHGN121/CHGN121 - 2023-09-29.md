### actual notes
- solutes and solvents like each other, ooooooo
- What holds solutes to solutes?
	- What holds solvents to solvents?
- What holds solutes and solvents together?
- When we're dissolving something, we 
	- Break oslutes apart (taking energy)
- Solute-solvents stick together, which releases energy

--- 
example time
- Dissolve NaCl in water
	- We gotta break them apart
	- If you were to write this out, you would show it separating into ions
- When we dissolve sucrose (C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>) in water, the different molecules of sucrose split up, but overall they stay together
	- If you were to write this out, the only difference is going from <sub>(s)</sub> to <sub>(aq.)</sub>
- fun fact: you can still use CiVi = CfVf with molarities, moles, ionss, yadaya
- We're eventually going to talk about electrolytes, which is quirky
	- ions are electrolytes, covalent compounds are not (except for those quirky little acids that are so cute and quirky)
