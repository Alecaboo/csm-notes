15m^3 to L $$\frac{15m^3}{1}*\frac{1L}{1*10^{-3}}=1.5*10^4L$$
## Classifying Matter (Based on composition)
### Pure Substance
- Composition does not vary based on where you look, how you look, what you look, whatever - the bottle of water just has water in it, you'll just find water molecules!

[H][O][H]
```

#### Further breakdown of pure substances
- Can either be composed of a single element (like random He floating around)
- Or compounds - stuff like water!
	- We can break these down further still
	- Molecular compounds (ie H<sub>2</sub>O)
	- Ionic compounds ie(NaCl)
### Mixture
- Is there more than one component in there? 
	- If so, mixture!
#### Heterogeneous Mixture
- Composition can vary - like wet sand, some parts might have more water than sand or vice versa
#### Homogenous Mixture
- Uniform composition, something like tea with sugar - it's the same throughout (even though its a mixture)

- All compounds are molecules, but not all molecules are compounds
