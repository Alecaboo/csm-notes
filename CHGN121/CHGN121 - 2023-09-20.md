oh wait the ones I don't know are the ones we don't need to care about, damn

## actual notes
- cadmium, zinc, something and something

12 on left
12 on right

#### scratchwork
4A + 6B<sub>2</sub> = 4AB<sub>3</sub>

2A + 3B<sub>2</sub> = 2AB<sub>3</sub>

## actual notes (real)
- thank god we're actually writing a reaction (ch. 4, chemical quantities and aq. reactions)
- Stoich time
	- 2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> = 2H<sub>2</sub>O
	- 2 molecules of hydrogen, 1 molecule of oxygen, makes 2 molecules of water
	- 10 h, 5o<sub>2</sub>, 2 molecules of water
	- 2(avogadro) hydrogen, 1(avogadro) oxygen, 2(avogadro) of water
	- For realsies, 2 moles H<sub>2</sub> + 1 mole O<sub>2</sub> = 2 moles H<sub>2</sub>O
	- If we were to convert into grams, 4.03g H<sub>2</sub> + 32.00g O<sub>2</sub> -> 36.03g H<sub>2</sub>O 
- fake equation for fakers 
	- 2A -> 3B 
	- The relationship between these two is the moles of A to Moles of B (2A:3B)
		- and wowie, we can convert from molar mass -> mass and from molar mass -> particles
- slightly more real equation for slightly more real folks
	- Fe2O3 + C -> Fe + CO2
	- 2 Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 3C -> 4Fe + 3CO<sub>2</sub>
	- how much would we produce from 150g Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
	- 0.94
	- 3/2 = 0.94/x
	- 2x = 3(0.94)
	- 1.41 moles CO<sub>2</sub>
	- 62.04g CO<sub>2</sub>

2NaOH + Cl<sub>2</sub> -> NaCLO + NaCl + H<sub>2</sub>O
Aiming for 0.353 mols NaCLO
Final answer is 28.2g NaOH, I leave the math as an exercise to the reader
