#### Q11:
Acetonitrile
$$\frac{52.6ml}{1}*\frac{0.89g}{mL}=46.8g$$
Dichloromethane $$\frac{1.54g}{1}*\frac{1mL}{0.89g}=1.73mL$$
#### Q13:
$$85.364g - 75.342g = 10.022g$$
##### Q14:$$10.022g *\frac{1.000g}{1mL} = 10.022mL$$
#### Q15:
$$27.5mL - 25.5mL = 2.0mL $$ 2.0ml = volume of bead$$\frac{3.652g}{2.0mL}= 1.8 \frac{g}{mL}$$
#### Q16:
mean = $\frac{5.2+5.0+5.3+5.3}{4}=5.2$ 
Standard deviation = $$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{(5.2-5.2)^2+(5.0-5.2)^2+(5.3-5.2)^2+(5.3-5.2)^2}{4}}=0.12$$
%RSD = $\frac{0.12}{5.2}*100=2.3$

#### Q17:
Q test: $$\frac{5.9-5.3}{5.9-5.0} = \frac{0.6}{0.9}= 0.66$$
With 5 values, consulting the Q-test table, yes, we should in fact reject 5.9 as an outlier... which means I went back and redid my old calculations
#### Q18:
$$\frac{|5.2-5.5|}{5.3}=5.66\% $$

#### Q19:
Molecular mass of FeCl<sub>3</sub>
$$\frac{55.847g}{1mol}Fe (1) + \frac{35.4527g}{1mol}(3) = 162.2051\ \text{g/mol}$$
Student A.
$$\frac{19.0g\  \text{FeCl}}{1}*\frac{1mol}{162.2051g} = 0.117mol $$
Student B.
$$\frac{18.99g\  \text{FeCl}}{1}*\frac{1mol}{162.2051g} = 0.1171mol $$
Student C. 
$$\frac{18.9925g\  \text{FeCl}}{1}*\frac{1mol}{162.2051g} = 0.117089mol $$


- For each student, they would report a number of moles proportional to the amount of significant figures in their answer. (3, 4, and 6, respectively). The conversion factor of the molecular mass of FeCl<sub>3</sub> is considered exact, so that does not factor in when considering significant figures.

#### Q20: 
1. Means
	- A. $$\frac{1.43+1.43+1.43+1.42}{4} = 1.43$$
	- B. $$\frac{1.24+1.23+1.25+1.22}{4}=1.24$$
	- C. $$\frac{1.19+1.23+1.22+1.26}{4} =1.23 $$
2. Percent Errors
	1. These values seem off because I kept the true mean values in my calculator out to (lots of decimals), but only wrote down abbreviated values. 
	- A. $$\frac{|1.43-1.23|}{1.23}*100 = 16.06\% $$
	- B.$$\frac{|1.24-1.23|}{1.23}*100 = 0.407\%$$
	- C. $$\frac{|1.23-1.23|}{1.23}=0.407\%$$
3. Standard Deviations
	- A. $$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{(1.43-1.43)^{2}+(1.43-1.43)^2+(1.43-1.43)^2+(1.42-1.43)^2}{4}}=0.005$$
	- B. $$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{(1.24-1.24)^{2}+(1.23-1.24)^2+(1.25-1.24)^2+(1.24-1.22)^2}{4}}=0.0129$$
	- C. $$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{(1.19-1.23)^{2}+(1.23-1.23)^2+(1.22-1.23)^2+(1.26-1.23)^2}{4}}=0.0290$$
- Conclusions
	- The most accurate device is the device closest to the true answer, while the most precise device is the one with the most consistent measurements. Given that the known value is 1.23cm, Device C is the closest, although only by a margin of 0.01cm, which is so close I'm not entirely convinced I didn't make an arithmetic error. This means Device C is the most accurate. Precision, on the other hand, can be evaluated by looking at the standard deviation of each device, in which case Device A is the clear runaway in terms of lowest mean standard deviation and therefore the most precise device.
