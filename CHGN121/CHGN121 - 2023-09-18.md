C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O E
B C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>15</sub>O<sub>6</sub>

## Chemical Naming
There's four categories
1. Binary Ionic (MgF<sub>2</sub> would be Magnesium Flouride)
2. Polyatomic Molecules ((NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> Ammonium Carbonate)
3. Molecular (or covalent compounds) (SO<sub>2</sub>, Sulfur Dioxide
4. Acids (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> is phosphoric acid)

Quick reminder:
- Changing oxygen content does not change the charge 
- Acid names exist, yuh
- You're allowed to lose 2 oxygens or gain 1 oxygen without changing charge 

NaH is a thing that exists, which would be sodium hydride

HCl is hydrochloric acid, HCl is just hydrogen monochloride

#toDo activity 7 naming practice is homework (one per person) **CRINGE**

## oh thank god we finally got to talking about reactions
- Chemical reaction is scrambling the way things are bound together
- The coefficients in stoic say how many moles there are. Wow! Crazy! 
- conservation of mass exists 
- If you're being all right and proper, you should write out the state of matter for everything
	- that's a loooot of work

yep balancing is easy
