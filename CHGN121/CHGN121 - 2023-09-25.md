## survey review stuff
- 4.18 g Li<sub>3</sub>N 
- 6.something
- the second one is 3 moles excess consumed, i have no idea why she bothered to go throuhg that much work


## more fun stoich
- we could just add more reactants, which, so silly, so quirky
- How much HCn do we make

2NH<sub>3</sub> + 3 O<sub>2</sub> + 2CH<sub>4</sub> -> HCN + 6 H<sub>2</sub>O
10g NH3
20g O2
5g CH4
how much of each reactant would remain if we produced 5g of HCN?

## strategies?
- do stuff, do your calculations well
