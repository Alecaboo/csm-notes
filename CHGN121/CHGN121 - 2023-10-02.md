- yeah my test is going to be here in CO 209
- what in the world is the name distribution A-D, E-Hn, Ho-Z


- Quick aside, mercury is quirky ahh hell, and has Hg<sub>2</sub>^+2
- We're not worrying about partial solubility at all, we consider things either infinitely soluble or completely insoluble 
Chem 1 level

### Three Reasons for a reaction to occur
1. Precipitate is formed
2. Water is formed (acid base)
3. Transfer of Electrons
	1. Redox, combustion


### Precipitation Reactions
- A precipitate is formed when soluble ionic reactants yield insoluble solids that condense themselves out of the solution
- If we make a precipitate, the reaction actually happens
	- If we have no precipitate, womp womp, there's no reaction, get trolled, L, bozo
- How do you do one of these?
	- Swip swap the cations, check if they're soluble, if one of em isn't we have a reaction, hip hip

Reaction
NaCl + AgNO<sub>3</sub> -> AgCl<sub>aq</sub> + NaNO<sub>3</sub><sub>(s)</sub>
