### Recap

What happened last week?
- Dimensional analysis
- Scientific Notation
- Sig figs

## Review?

#### Precision vs Accuracy
- Precise measurements are close to each other (reproduceable)
- Accurate measurements are close to the target/expected value
- All measurements have a degree of uncertainty
- Repeat measurements several times to increase confidence in a result

Percent error

$$\% \ error = \frac{experimental \ value - true\ value}{true \ value} * 100 $$

Standard deviation exists

#### Structure -> Properties -> Function

- Chapter 2 going to start on Friday, should be about done with Chapter 1 


## Classifying [[States of Matter]]

### Solids (s)
- Ordered
- Close packing
- Fixed locations
- Particles vibrate
	- (as long as we're above 0K, absolute zero)
- Rigid shape
- Fixed volume
### Liquid (*l*)
- Close packing
- Free to move
- No fixed shape
- Fixed volume
### Gas (g)
- Lots of space
- Free to move
- Compressible
- Assume shape and volume of container

(aq) aqueous solution

## Change

### Physical Change
- Changing states is a physical change - there's no change in physical state
- Ex: Dry Ice
	- Solid CO2 sublimates directly to a gas, but is still CO2
- Ex: Dissolution
	- Dissolving sucrose C12H22O11
### Chemical Change
- Ex: Rust
	- Pure iron nail oxides, this is chemical change
	- 4 Fe + 3O2 -> 2Fe2O3

## Properties of Matter

### Extensive Properties
- Depends on the amount of substance present
- Like mass, volume
- "Value" is directly proportional to amount
### Intensive Property
- Does not depend on how much of the substance is present
- Density, temperature, boiling point
- Can be used to identify substance 

# Examples

- Plants making sugar from carbon dioxide and water is an example of a physical change
