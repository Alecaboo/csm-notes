## yippee quantum mechanics
- spdf is the shape of the robital
- You can also draw the boxes, if you're crazy
- we can use our periodic table to place electrons in energy levels
- Pauli Exclusion Principle
	- A single orbital can hold two electrons with opposing spins
- Hund's Rule
	- in the same energy level, we half fill everything first with parallel spins before we start going wild
- Aufbau (Building in Deutsch)
	- Fill lower energy levels first
- for transition metals, we also count the d orbital when considering valence electrons
