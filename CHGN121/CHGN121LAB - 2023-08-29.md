### Prelab
#### Definitions
1. Accuracy is how "good" your measurements are - how close they are to the expected / target value
2. Precision is how similar your values are to each other; even if your target value is 10, if all your values are very very close to 14, they are very precise
3. Systematic Error is experimental error caused by a systematic mistake, like consistently using inches instead of centimeters on a ruler.
4. Random error is caused by random circumstances like wind or differences in placement on a scale - there is no consistent source of error, it just happens
#### Equations:
Mean: $$\bar{x} = \frac{sum \ of \ results}{number \ of \ results}$$
Standard Deviation: (good god I have no idea how to type THAT in latex)
![[standard deviation.png]]
Percent Relative Standard Deviation
$$\%RSD = \frac{SD}{\bar{x}}*100$$
#### Q Test
- Q test are used to test if a value is an outlier
- A data point can be excluded if Q is greater than the corresponding critical value for the size of your data set in the Critical Values for Rejection Quotient table
- ![[Critical Values for Rejection Quotient.png]]
- only ONE value can be rejected

### Actual Lab

- Obligatory nothing goes down the drain except pure water
- #toDo post lab & safety quiz and agreement
