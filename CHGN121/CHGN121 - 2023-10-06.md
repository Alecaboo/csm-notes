#chemistry #notes #chgn121


- chem exam grades are going to get posted tomorrow afternoon
	- Answer key is also going to get posted
		- Exam packet is going to come back Monday lecture

- Potassium nitrate is soluble as shit, answer to that clicker question
- BRO WE DON'T EVEN COVER LEWIS ACIDS WTF
- Water is amphoteric, can act as an acid or a base
- Now we gon talk about **STRONK** acids or weak bases
	- chem 2 apparently has nuance but for us it's either strong or weak

## strong acids and bases
- Strong acids fully ionize, strong electrolytes, the whole nine yards
- Hydrofluoric acid only partially ionizes - it wouldn't form a full 2 moles worth of ions
	- we aren't good enough to calculate that, apparently
	- when a weak acid (like HF) dissolves, we would mostly see intact HF floating around, not any of the ions
- Strong bases also fully ionize, alkali hydroxides are pretty good shit
- NaOH fully ionzies, major species are the ions
- Also strong electrolytes!
- Weak bases are f\*cking cowards who can't go through a breakup without hanging on
	- they're also terrible electrolytes
	- we would have mostly intact weak base molecules floating around
- For determining strong and weak acids and bases, we just use the equation sheet because chem 1 is a baby class for babies
	- consider everything on the table to completely ionize
	- if it's not on the table, we consider it weak

## Chem 1 being for babies 
### Acids
- Acids will always have H listed first in formula, or have "acid" in the name
### Bases
- Composed of metal or polyatomic cation with OH-, O2- and NH2- 
- one other relevant base is NH<sub>3</sub> (ammonia), which is weak
- we got mono, di, and triprotic acids (polyprotic acids)
- i ruined my perfect clicker record by being lazy

- Acid base reactions we're most going to go around and form a salt and water
- oh great googly moogly we're titrating 
- we have some clickers next week
