## 1750 Jackson
- Fully furnished apartments, bathroom & kitchen
- Remain open during winter break
- No meal plan required
	- You can have one, it's also right next to safeway
- Parking is availible under the building, as an additional lottery (but reportedly there's pretty reliable access)
- Amenities!
	- Gym in jackson, grills, social spaces, bike lockers
- We'll get into roommate groups...... later!

## Environmental Justice SLC
- "Discuss the sustainable and environmental impacts of students' chosen major/career field"
- General environmental stuff
- You need to apply to the SLC specifically (not the plan)
	- About 20 people, they do get chosen

## Maple Hall
- Also has sophomore housing, but required meal plan, closes during winter break, only double double units allowed
- No in-unit kitchen 
- Not the plan
	- I honestly stopped taking notes on this because I well and truly am not interested 


## Jackson v Maple
- 360 bedspaces total in Jackson (with 20 reserved for the SLC)
	- Maple has a whopping 27
- ![[Screenshot 2024-01-18 at 6.14.08â€¯PM.png]]
- Vast majority of rooms in Jackson are 2/3 bedroom units
- All lottery based


## Application Timeline
- Opens at 10:00 AM MST on Thurs Feb 1st
	- Closes at 11:59 on Feb 4th, it doesn't matter when you apply - lottery is lottery
- How to get there!
	- Residence life housing portal on Trailhead / my.mines

## Roommate Groups
- This is for general applications (me!)
	- When creating roommate groups, choose the Supreme Ultra Roommate (also known as the Group Leader)
		- Default is the creator of the roommate group, but can be changed around
	- If roommate group is selected in the lottery, SUR is responsible for selecting the unit and bedspaces for everybody
		- SUR will be routed to the unit selection page for the timeslot that we get assigned
			- SUR gets to pick like three / four bedroom unit, if a certain room type ends up being not available, part of the roommate group can choose to jump ship
				- Alec general plan: I would very much prefer to actually have a single room, so if we end up with a double double, I would really rather not (but would make that decision on the fly)
			- When the SUR makes the decision on the room, we get a tentative hold on the room
				- Group members are then sent a housing contract - head back to the Jackson app page, we MUST SIGN AND CONFIRM ***DURING*** the timeslot
					- If somebody has not signed their housing contract within the timeslot, you are BOOTED. GONE.
- Environmental Justice apps have some extra stuff going on
	- (I don't caaareeeee......)
- Co-ed living
	- Create a roommate group by choosing roommates that mix gender identities
	- Any open spaces will be defaultly filled in
	- Do not opt in to co-ed if your desire is only based on the specific people you're living with
		- I plan to be a single, I really don't mind and will probably opt in
- Order of acceptance
	- Enviro folks get let in
		- Then general jackson lottery
			- then finally maple
- Rates are not yet finalized for next year
- $50 application fee, but if you are not offered housing, it will be refunded
- There are several rounds of lottery, will be notified throughout February
	- No advantage to applying with roommate group vs without
- Jackson offers will be sent out by feb 16th, with timeslots the following week
	- Timeslots will be open for two days
- Cancellation things exist in the contract
- Wednesday March 13th

## Mines Park
- Also a thing that exists, straight up apartments, no dedicated space for sophomores because the buildings are being renovated
- All happens after Jackson acceptances and stuff - so look into after that
