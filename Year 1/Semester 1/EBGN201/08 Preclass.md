1. One specific example of a decrease in labor caused by technology is the development of mechanized agriculture. Progressive technological developments have reduced the need for relatively unskilled farm labor - machines have replaced much of the physical work. For instance, a combine harvester is capable of reaping and threshing grain, simplifying what used to be the task of several men or a team of oxen into one man's work with a device. 
2. Continuing the farming example, I think if "old style" farmers were being replaced by trained machinists, it would be absolutely reasonable to compensate them with assistance transitioning into a new job (which may even be farming, just with the addition of new technology).
