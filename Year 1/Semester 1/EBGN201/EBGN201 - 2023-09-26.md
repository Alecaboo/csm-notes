- Market efficiency is when a market yields the largest possible economic surplus
- Producer surplus is basically the same thing as profits (neat)

#### efficiency 
- Market has to be perfectly competitive 
	- Market power causes markets to be inefficient 
		- A firm that has power can raise prices, which reduces efficiency 
- Government can get up to some shenanigans
- Irrational Decisions
	- That's covered by behavioral economics
- Private information
- Supply and demand curve meeting is ideal - dead weight loss is when something like a government quota forces underproduction, for example

- we're going to be talking about government today, market power next week, then externatlaities

### Government Regulations
- Taxes & Subsidies
	- Four step plan (subsidy is the opposite of this)
	1. Is the supply or demand shifting (who is being taxed/)
	2. Is that shift an increase in taxes, shifting the curve to the left?
		1. Or is it a decrease in taxes, increasing demand, shifting the curve to the right
	3. How will prices and quantities change in the new equilibrium?
		1. We need elasticities
	4. Is demand more or less elastic than supply?
		1. Whoever is more inelastic will bear more burden of the tax

- Pre-class activities

## Price Regulations
- Price Ceilings and Price Floors
	- You cannot sell your kidney, only donate, so there's a price ceiling of $15,000
- Ceilings above the equilibrium price don't do anything
- Floors below the equilibrium don't do anything
### Quantity Regulations
- Mandates and Quotas
	- Mandate
		- health insurance
	- "You can't build tall buildings here, because this is a residential area"
- Pretty much no matter what happens, prices go up
