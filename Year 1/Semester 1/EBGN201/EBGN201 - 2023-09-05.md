### Demand
- Demand is down-sloping
	- We're willing to pay more depending on how many units are in the market
	- Demand curve *is* the marginal benefit curve
	- Consumer surplus maximization - keep buying until marginal benefit equals marginal cost
- Steps to derive a market demand curve
	1. Survey a representative sample, asking each person the quantity they will buy
	2. For each price, add up the total quantity
	3. Make projections about the total quantity demanded by the entire market
	4. Plot the quantity demanded by the entire market at each price
- Changes in price cause changes in quantity demanded 
	- Change that the model explains is shift along the curve, change that the model does not explain is moving the entire curve
### Supply
- Supply is upward sloping
	- When we produce more, marginal costs increase
	-
