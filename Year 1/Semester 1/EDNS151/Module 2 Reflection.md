#edns151 #design 

This unit, I learned a lot about prototyping, as well as how to evaluate prototypes. The prototype I was assigned to develop was my team's recycling app, an idea that was completely feasible, within the skillset of the team, as well as doable within the semester while helping to address the problem. On the other hand, it was a bit of a pain to develop a prototype that effectively represented user flow for a presentation - in the past, I had experience making app prototypes for direct user testing, but just showing off to an environment was a different challenge that I didn't really prepare for. I tried to make my prototype similar to how I would do user testing in my previous design experience, and not adapting ultimately made my prototype fairly poor in the grand scheme. Furthermore, the app was very unoriginal, and ultimately brought little novelty to the table - so ensuring that I keep novelty in mind both for this class and future engineering is something that I will be sure to consider in the future.  The failings of my own prototype aside, my team overall did an excellent job of combining our skills and ideas to create a diverse set of prototypes - we had a variety of designs, across a variety of solutions, made from a variety of materials. I would say that I was excellently able to work with the rest of my team, and the rest of my team was able to excellently work with each other.
