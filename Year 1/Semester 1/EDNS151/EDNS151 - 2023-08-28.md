[[Problem Definition]]


## Team A - Yippee

- Probably going to be meeting on Thursdays?



## Call For Proposals

### "Upcycle Everything"
- You need to identify the problems
	- Take into account the stakeholders, employees, landowners, end users, big big picture
	- Solution must be repeatable or scalable - try to avoid custom built, one off solutions
#### Requirements
- Stakeholder group in mind
- Proposal must quantify positive impacts as well as negatives, including a risk-mitigation plan
- Products or processes, but most be prototyped, modeled, and validated
- Safe to students
- Prototype budget of $100
- Think about society
- BUDGETS ARE AN ILLUSION!
#### References
- refer back to the challenge, silly

## Problem Definition
- Define the problem first, then solutions, not the other way
- There is practically an infinite number of problems, the amount if only constrained by
	- understanding
	- Imagination
	- Available time
- Problem solving grid
- Narrow -> Broad on the x axis
- Technical -> Non-technical on the y axis
- Use your recycling buglist, put it on the map
###### Upcycling is a solution, it's not actually the problem

#### Department ideas
- skills
- creativity
- funding
- market demand
- Regulations & compliance
- Cost & budget
- Education & Training
- Environmental Impact
