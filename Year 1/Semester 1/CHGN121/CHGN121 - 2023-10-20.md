## Clickers
- it was actually A I just punched in the wrong numbers
- E, 32.9 L

## partial pressures
- The total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures (wow)
	- this is technically Dalton's law, but he's lame
- We can calculate partial pressures out of a total mixture if we know their individual components
- We can figure out moles of each gas, the total moles, the total pressure, the pressure of each gas, this shit's *wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiild*
- If we're in the same container, temperature and volume are going to be samesies, so the ratio of individual pressure / total pressure 
- A mole fraction is represented with a $\chi$ 
- Individual pressure is $\chi$ * P<sub>total</sub>

### time to talk about why ideal is cringe

- We're going to have a bunch of postulates saying why this shit happens
	- This is KMT 
		- Gases are tiny particles, and they move about at random
		- Volumes of particles themselves is incredibly tiny relative to the total volume - gas is mostly empty space
		- We assume that gas particles act independently with no forces between particles
		- Gasses have energy transfer when they collide, but we assume fully elasti collisions so the average kinetic energy does not change
		- Average kinetic energy is proportional to temeprate in K of sample
- Yeah, kinetic energy is relevant
- $KE= \frac{1}{2}(mv^{2})$ , so the lighter the gas, the faster it has to go 
	- We're not going to do calculations, but you do need to consider how increasing mass reduces speed
- Diffusion is us mixing with other things
	- Path it takes for gas to get to somewhere else is the mean free path, which is neat to know
	- Diffusion rate scales with speed
- Effusion is very specifically looking at gasses moving through a membrane or a pinhole
	- Effusion rate is also proportional to molecular speed and therefore mass
		- we used effusion in uranium enrichment, which is cute

## Get real.
- Volume of gas is larger than what gets predicted by the ideal gas law
- Attraction between molecules does actually happen, and it's more important at high pressures or low temperatures
- Let's go check up on a mol 
	- Yeah, uh, that shit's not always 1
	- Welcome to the real world
- This means that real gasses are not infinitely compressible! You start getting liquids at high pressures and/or low temperatures
