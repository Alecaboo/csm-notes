## hydrogen bond quick stuff
- You can either have the hydrogen on your molecule connected to O, N, or F, in which case you'll be hookin' up with an oxygen
	- Oooooor, if you have an oxygen floatin around, you can hook that up with a hydrogen and that'll be a happy pairing
- MgO Strongest

## property shenanigans
- Vapor pressure can only be really observed in a closed system
- Larger surface area means a faster rate of vaporization
	- That's because these transitions are the outermost molecules skedaddling - very hard to convince the innermost ones to scamper away, since they're so well held on all sides
	- Surface area does NOT affect vapor pressure - the same pressure of gas is going to leave, no matter surface area
- Temperature lets more atoms hit "escape velocity" and they can run away
