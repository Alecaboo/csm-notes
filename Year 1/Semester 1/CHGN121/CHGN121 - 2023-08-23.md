#### Fall '22 Cohort Advice
1. Preview topics before class
2. Treat Mastering homework like a test
3. Study as if you're going to teach someone
	1. I mean yeah, that's good study habits, go teach someone
4. Office hours
5. Sleepytime

- Uncertain
	- Estimate ONE past last certain digit
	- We know it's between 15.0 and 15.1
	- So it was actually 15.00
## [[Significant Figures]] Rules

### Significant Digits


- Non zero numbers are always significant
- Leading zeroes are never significant (because they could be replaced by scientific notation)
- Interior zeroes between numbers are significant
- Trailing zeroes are significant **IF** the number has a decimal
	- (otherwise they could be replaced by scientific notation)
- You gotta use scientific notation or it'll be marked wrong (l, cringe, loser)
- 
### Algebra Rules
#### Adding or Subtracting
- Always go by the least number of decimal places
- So whatever your final answer is, round to the last number of decimal places
#### Multiplying or Dividing
- Go by the least number of significant figures
-

There's a bunch of unit conversions in the workbook / equation sheet! Wow!

Conversion factors are considered exact - don't worry about it!

Sig figs are only for measurement values we don't consider exact
