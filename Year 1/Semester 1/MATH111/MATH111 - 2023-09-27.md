- derivative of position is velocity
- derivative of velocity is acceleration


---- 
Moving horizontally along a line (this is not what was in the worksheet)
$$f(t) = 2t^{3}-21t^{2}+60t$$
$$v(t)=6t^{2}-42t+60 \ = (6)(t^{2}-7t+10) = (6)(t-5)(t-2)$$
$$a(t)=12t-42$$
1. Displacement?
	1. just plug that in
		1. so the answer is 77-0, 77 ft
2. Total distance traveled 
	1. 52+27 +52 = 131ft (feet are cringe, I miss meters)
	2.
