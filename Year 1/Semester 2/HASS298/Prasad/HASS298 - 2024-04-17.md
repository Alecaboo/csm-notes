Been at mines for about 20 years, about 10 years in industry


--- 

## Industry
- Oil and gas is concerned about methane in specific
	- Concerned about CO2, buuut, not really about methane
		- Methane is worse, so, yeah, checks out
- Colorado is one of the more regulated states, currently leading the nation
	- Mines gets to do a lot of research
	- California is by far the most regulated, but Colorado is pulling second
- Oil and gas industry is HUGE in Colorado
	- Does a lot for the economy of Colorado
- Lots of studies on how methane leaks out of different operations
	- How you prevent or control that as much as possible
- How do you measure it?
	- Sensor components, you want measurements, but they gotta be cheap
		- Weather>
	- Data analytics problem at that point
	- You could have little $10 point sensors, but also fly a big old drone over
		- Up to a certain height,
		- past that they do plane flyovers
	- Also satellite systems
- Where, what, where does money need to go?
- Along with measuring, just reducing some of the surface level emissions stuff
	- Doing work to figure out like, where is it failing, can we replace that to be low emissions?
- There's also just natural methane that... just kinda happens
	- So controlling what we can vs can't

#### co2 side of it
- Only really happens when a well is flaring and it's actively burning
	- Banned in Colorado
- Lots of what Mines does is CCUS, sequestration of the CO2 
	- Great idea, but, like... how well does that work?
- The industry actually injects CO2 in a good amount of the time
- Rangely colorado has the largest oil field in Colorado, and they've been injecting CO2 since the 80s
	- Which is great! Does double buisness
- Chevron sold it recently to a company that focuses on carbon sequestration in addition to oil production


### Production vs Emission Reduction?
- You hear a lot about like Oil and gas going away, by producing more you're continuing to propagate the issue?
	- Little hamster wheel going on with the sequestration to make more oil
- Real issue is that there is no real alternative
	- Standard of living, population, energy security, people want all of these, oil and gas just isn't going anywhere
	- We gotta find the right/better way of doing things
- Nobody is out there to pollute the environment, they're trying to meet a need and find better ways of oding that


- Energy transistion
	- Better phrase might be energy evolution?
	- Are we going to be using oil and gas in 100 years? Dunno
		- In fifty years though? Almost certainly
	- Focus now is a bit different than what it was in the past
		- Technology now is better than it was, there's lots of opportunities
		- US became a net exporter about fifteen years ago in terms of oil, and we're doing it cleaner to boot
			- Also gotta make sure that makes it to the rest of the world
- Back to original question - not really a conflict
- 35% of the research int he department (petroleum engineering) is not petroleum - it's stuff like hydrogen, geothermal, sequestration

- Standard of living and population are the biggest drivers for still needing oil


## Is civilization now too rooted in petroleum?
Yeah.

- Well, expanding on that, there's no real good substitute
- To make a jump to something like EV, we would need like, a 4000% increase in lithium and rare metal production
	- We haven't really figured out electric planes
	- We still use a lot of natural gas
	- How to make geothermal viable in places where it doesn't just happen"?
- In order to replace the amount of energy used by natural gas, there needs to be about $500,000,000,000 of geothermal investment
- Biden admin has been doing great for sequestration - just threw 4 billion dollars into it, but that's 4/500
- Only about half of every petroleum barrel goes into energy - the other half goes into plastics 
- It's going to be a gradual taper - 


### What's happening to that manufacturing half?
- Lots of people don't realize that such a large fraction is going to manufacturing
- Wind don't blow, sun don't shine, you need batteries
	- Part of the reason that geothermal is so interesting is that ground's always hot
- Energy security
	- Germany was getting rid of nuclear, France was ramping up nuclear, Germany is now building coal-fired power plants (with shitty local coal) 
		- That's because Russia-Ukraine happened
			- Russia makes 19-20% of the world's natural gas, US is 24%, Saudi Arabia is about 21%
				- No wonder there's a lot of conflict going on there

### Even if the US can get away, what about the rest of the world?
- We lead the way on the industrial revolution, so we started burning a lot of stuff first, so now we're looking away from it faster
- ARAM-CO (spelling?) the Saudi oil company is looking from being an Oil company into being an energy company in the future
- Lots of development happening in Africa right now
	- Standard of living
		- They could do hydrogen, geothermal, but it's so much cheaper to do oil and gas
- Emissions and global are very much a world problem, but there are also 200 countries worth of problems
	- Europe and America will probably end up being the leaders

### Mines Petroleum Engineering in the Future
- Are they going to change from like, Petroleum to Energy engineering?
- Mines is fundamentally an energy school, Petroleum is just one leg of the energy system of the entire school
- They don't expect to change their name but they're absolutely changing their curriculum and research path - (lots of that portfolio is already over there)
- Hiring new faculty with specialties in stuff like machine learning, hydrogen, classes are now being offered in those new pathways (CCUS, geothermal)
	- Just developed a new curriculum on CCUS stuff, how to drill sequestration well
- Petroleum isn't going away, so it's an evolution, more than a change
- As a department head, there are the traditionalists saying like, oil forever vs the realistic people who recognize the transition
	- Other petroleum departments are finding the same thing
	- Going to be good sub-surface engineers


### How much do you think about your own emissions and those of the department?
- Think a whole lot more about it now than twenty years ago!
- It's something of a disservice to students if we *don't* think about it
- Pushed hard as department head to get talk about emissions in seminar classes and other things
- Some new faculty have specialties in that
- Thinking about emissions for a new car, but also like, a petroleum engineer with a full solar array on her house
- Kinda thing you gotta lead by doing


- Part of it is just the right thing to do, but the other part is the public at large driver - the government is going to start shutting down production (and rightly so) 
	- Kind of "license to operate," if we're going to keep doing things, we better keep doing it right

- Gotta make sure students can't just sell to the vice president of their company - they can sell to their county commissioner, the public at large, relay that they hear their concerns, for sure something the pendulum has swung on


### Why did you come to Mines? Is there something you saw different here?
- This is where she got her masters and Phd from, and it's a great place to stay and got an offer for it
- In hindsight, looking at the department has a really good balance -
	- Research focused, but also with a lot of industry connections
	- P. Engineering is a general jack of all trades, for instance LSU is a drilling, Texas A&M is reservoir engineering
- Just kinda liked the area, honestly
- Was working in Louisiana before happily coming back to the Rockies
