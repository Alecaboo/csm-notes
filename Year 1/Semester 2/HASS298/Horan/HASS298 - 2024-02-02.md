- This seminar wraps up in a week, off to the races we go
- People used to be a lot closer to their energy sources, because it didn't really travel well
- Petroleum from coal was, essentially, just going deeper underground
	- Disclaimer: given by a history professor and may not be accurate
	- Petroleum enables direct combustion of your fossil fuel, instead of going through a roundabout medium like steam
	- Petroleum is also a hell of a lot easier than coal to transport - a tad counterintuitively, but it's really a whole lot easier to move a whole lot of petroleum long distances
- Coal use was based on pre-existing consumption - we fundamentally had the idea of burning coal, but like, in 1800, petroleum consumption is a whopping 0
	- In the last few decades of the 1800s, that went up to 20 million metric tons of petroleum, up to 3 billion in 1990, 2010 added another billion metric tons
- A coal mine in England can only really support coal in England - when the US wanted to use coal, we needed to find it locally (Pennsylvania), and other areas would support their own coal bubbles
- Companies can't just focus on one petroleum strike - you don't just want to be in Pennsylvania, you also want to be tapping California, and the North sea, etc, etc
- Petrocapitalism doubled the amount of global trade happening (by percent), by 2000 it was close to 70% trade - which is WILD when it was 10%
	- Petroleum encouraged this global view that just... didn't really exist before
- Eastern Europe kicked off kerosene, which is cute, but Pennsylvania ended up being the major major hub going forward
	- They were already experienced with coal, might as well keep going
- Great big gouts of fire!
