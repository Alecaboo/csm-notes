- Texas National guard was going around policing wells to make sure that they stop overproducing
- Capitalism is definitely NOT enough to force energy transitions to happen, I think government is absolutely needed
	- I mean like, we had to sponsor the development of engines with the world's fair significantly, we had to have the manhattan project, opec, every major energy transition in recent memory has needed a significant degree of government intervention to actually function in a reasonable manner. 
- Biiiiiig oil
	- God, Upton Sinclair was on a  TEAR
		- wrote the Jungle, wrote Oil (became There Will be Blood) 
	- Standard Oil (founded by good ol' oil magnate Rockefeller, who shipped oil west, where the population was going to be, rather than where it was in the east)
		- Munched up some rival companies to set standardized oil rates
			- Government gave em a realllll funny look for having a bit *too* much power
- Royal Dutch Shell has become Shell, Standard Oil of California has become Chevron, Britain is to blame for the oil rush in the middle east, founding the Anglo-Iranian Oil, now British Petroleum
- The world just kinda reoriented itself around petroleum
	- Banks relied on investments in Oil
	- Most currencies (and the stock market) generally fluctuate with oil prices

### Futurerama
###### not that one
- General Motors (based in Detroit) 
- Perspective of the future, rama has a massive image of urban sprawl
	- People would live a more spread out, comfortable live (aka, suburbs)
		- aaaand they would have cars. 50,000 miniature cars.
		- Petrol would drive a new, transport based future!



- Petroleum allowed people to spread out, coal (and all previous energy transitions) had generally condensed people
- Ultimately things are driven by human choices
