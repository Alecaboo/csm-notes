### Innov8x - Sid Saleh
- brings in problems from industry, either in a three credit hour course or in like a two hour challenge (or a few weeks, but, yuh)
- get to work on a real project that you get to actually talk about
- entrepreneurs are people very dedicated to solving problems that they're excited about
- if you can build something, you can show that to people
- hearing my main man PCJ referred to as President Johnson feels a little weird
- you're hired to innovate, not to warm chairs
