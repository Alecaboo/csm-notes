- Gotta be aware of the subjective responses to colors
	- Also color blindness - red and green is fairly common
- Hue is the outermost pure color wheel section, value is tint / light / dark, etc
- Saturation is intensity - modified by using the opposite end of the color wheel
- Warm vs Cool
	- Warm colors are perceived as being closer
	- Warm is close to yellow, Cool is close to blue
- *Coheeeesion*
- Too much saturation can bleed details out
- Rule of thirds
- Fibonacci ratio ends up being 1: 1.618

- Negative space is a really fun thing to play with and use to draw attention
- If you introduce and element, it's best to repeat it (probably)
