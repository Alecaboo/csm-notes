Concise text can effectively convey information to your reader, but the longer you go the more likely that you’ll lose their attention. I mean, really, who wants to read a rambling paragraph that just keeps going on and on and on? Full paragraphs will generally lose readers about halfway through, and going any longer than that is just indulgent. You probably didn’t even make it this far in this one, which is just further proof of why you should keep text concise. I'm serious, like, if you're reading this far, you're bored, and just curious about how far we were willing to take the bit. We were willing to commit I tell you. Seriously, do NOT copy this. It is NOT a good idea. Remember: keep it short and sweet.
