[[PHGN100 - Block One]]
- Phys tends to write vectors in terms of $\vec V = V_x\hat\imath + V_{y}\hat\jmath+ V_{z}\hat k$
- If $\vec V$ is a vector, then $V$ is its magnitude
	- Question to ask
		- If something is positive or negative
- Alright let's get to integrating acceleration ig
	- $$v_x(t_f)=v_x(t_i)+\int_{t_i}^{t_f}a_x(t)dt$$
	$$v_i\sin\theta=\int_{t_i}^{t_f}a_0e^{t/t_i}dt$$
	$$v_i\sin\theta+a_ot_ie^{t/t_i}\Big|_{t_i}^{t_f}$$
	You get there using $u= \frac{t}{t_{i}}$
