### work and kinetic energy shenanigans
- Work is a scalar
- We generally use joules for energy and work done
	- You don't have to push the whole object, we want the displacement of where the force is being applied
- Obligatory note about einstein being a pain in the neck and mass being energy yadayada
- We've got conservative and non-conservative forces
	- Conservative forces are....
		- independent of the path
		- Depend only on the endpoints
		- On a closed path, the work of a conservative force is equal to 0
		- Gravity and Ideal Springs
- $$gmh = mv^{2}$$$$\sqrt{gh}=v$$
Block go slippy slidey, it was on a closed path and the work was nonzero, so the force must not be conservative.

$$\sin = \frac{\Delta h}{hyp}$$
$$\sin\theta * d= \Delta h$$
Aaand we want energy, so it's $$gm\sin\theta * d$$
maybe.


$$W_{\vec{F}}= \int _{s_{i}}^{s_{f}}\vec{F}_{ab}\cdot d\vec{s}$$
$$\vec{W}_{Eb}=m_{b}g(\sin\theta)\hat\imath - m_{b}g (\cos\theta)\hat\jmath$$
$$\hat\jmath$$ doesn't really exist, since we don't float off ther amp

aaaaand that works back out to $$m_{b}g\sin\theta *d$$
$$\sqrt{2g\sin\theta*d}$$
should be the velocity
