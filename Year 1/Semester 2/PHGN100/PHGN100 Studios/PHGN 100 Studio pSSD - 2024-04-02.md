1. Evaluating the left hand side (the impulse) is fairly straightforward - we just want to be able to integrate force with respect to time. Conveniently, we're given a force vs time graph![[F(t).png]]
in order to integrate and get a value, we just want the area under the "curve," so we can just make a triangle with a base being time, and then going to the corresponding height, calculating the area of which will give us our impulse. In the given situation where $t_{i}=0$ and $t_{f}=6$, this would just be $3*6=18N*s$


2. In order to figure out momentum, we need velocity in some way - it's equal to mass * velocity, so using the velocity vs time graph is fairly convenient for finding the velocity at two given points. However, we are not given mass, but we can conveniently pull it out of the Force vs Acceleration graph - force and acceleration are related by N2L - $F=ma$, which is already in the form $y=mx$ when considering the Force vs Acceleration graph. Mass is simply the slope of the force v acceleration graph, which gives us a constant that we can then multiply the velocity we pull off the other graph by.

- So, for the same $t_{i}=0$ and $t_{f}=6$, mass would be 6kg pulling off the graph, and velocity at 0 would be 0, and velocity at 6 is 3 m/s, so the change in momentum = $18 kg * m/s$


- Hey, we got the same answer! Awesome!

## Follow Up Questions
- Solidified the relationships between different physics quantities when given a large variety of graphs - for instance, being able to pull mass of a $F(a)$ graph. 
- I'm curious why we were given position for the two graphs - was that simply an alternate route of going, because as far as we could tell, we had no need of position and could simply calculate using time.
