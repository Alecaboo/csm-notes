- Using the given quantities in each problem, the easiest approach was to use angular momentum. The objects were spinning, so linear momentum doesn't make sense to use, and we didn't have nearly enough information to account for all the energy present in the system (and if we were, there would be no work, which would really just complicate the whole thing)

- Another problem that could use the conservation of angular momentum is in the orbit of a satellite, spinning around a planet. If an asteroid were to hit the satellite and change it's rotation (and increase moment of inertia), that would be an angular momentum probkem.
