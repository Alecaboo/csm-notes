$$1.2 kg * 1.4 \frac{m}{s} = p = 1.68 kg \frac{m}{s}$$
$$1.176  \text{kg * m}^{2} \frac{}{s} = 25 * \omega$$
$$1.2 * 1.4 * \sin(60) = \omega ( 30 + 1.2 * 0.7^{2})$$
$$0.7 *1.2 * 1.4 * \sin (60 \deg) / (30 + 1.2*0.7^2)$$
- Wrench was coming in at an angle, so it had less velocity able to cause torque, meaning the first case was greater.
