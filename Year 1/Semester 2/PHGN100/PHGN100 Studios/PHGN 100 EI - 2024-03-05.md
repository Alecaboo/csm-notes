Goal: Experimentally determine the moment of inertia of a rod through use of several methods.

Picture:

We've got a rod with two masses on the ends, a pulley in the middle connected to the rod, with a hangar mass at the end of the pulley.


Solid black rod - 26g
Each mass is 75g since brass

Distance from center of rod to center of masses is 18cm
Total length of rod = 38cm

$$(\frac{1}{12})M_{rod}(L_{rod})^{2}+ (M_{brass}*R_{brass}^{2})+(M_{brass}*R_{brass}^{2})$$
$$(\frac{1}{12})M_{rod}(L_{rod})^{2}= 0.0003128666667 \ kg m^{2}$$

$$(0.0003128666667 )+ 0.00486= 0.005172866667 \ \text{kg*m}^{2}$$

$$\sum\limits \tau = r*T_{hp}+mMgR-mMgR$$

$$r*T_{hp}=I_{b}*(\frac{a}{r})$$
$$\frac{r*T_{hp}}{\frac{a}{r}}$$
$$\frac{rT_{hp}}{1}*\frac{r}{a}$$
$$I_{b}= \frac{(r)(rT_{hp})}{a}$$
$$I_{b}=\frac{r^{2}T_{hp}}{a}$$
$$\sum\limits F=m_{h}*a_{h}$$
$$(m_{h}g-T_{ph})=m_{h}*a_{h}$$
$$T_{ph}=m_{h}g-m_ha_{h}$$
$$I_{b}= \frac{r^{2}(m_hg-m_ha_h)}{a_{h}}$$

---

$$I_{b}a_{h}= r^{2}(m_{h}g-m_{h}a_{h})$$
$$I_{b}a_{h}= r^{2}m_{h}g - m_{h}a_{h}r^{2}$$
$$I_{b}a_{h}+ m_{h}a_{h}r^{2}= r^{2}m_{h}g$$
$$a_{h}(I_{b}+m_{h}r^{2})=r^{2}m_{h}g$$
$$a_{h}= \frac{r^{2}m_{h}g}{I_{sys}+m_{h}r^{2}}$$

---

$$\int a_{hdt=} = a_{h}\int dt = a_{h}t $$
$$\int a_{h}tdt= a_{h}\int tdt = \frac{a_{h}t^{2}}{2}=\Delta Y$$
$$a_{h}=  \frac{\Delta Y*2}{t^{2}}$$

Combining the two acceleration equations


$$\frac{\Delta y *2}{t^{2}}= \frac{r^{2}m_{h}g}{I_{sys}+m_{h}r^{2}} $$
$$\frac{(\Delta y*2)(I_{sys}+ m_{h}r^{2})}{t^2}=r^{2}m_{h}g$$
$$(\Delta y*2)(I_{sys}+ m_{h}r^{2})= r^{2}m_{h}g*t^{2}$$
$$I_{sys}+ m_{h}r^{2}= \frac{r^{2}m_{h}g*t^{2}}{\Delta y *2}$$
$$I_{sys}= \frac{r^{2}m_{h}g*t^{2}}{\Delta y*2}-m_{h}r^{2}$$
$r$ is outer radius, for posterity, which is also what we need to calculate $\Delta y$
$$I_{sys}= \frac{r^{2}m_{h}g*t^{2}}{(\text{revolutions}*2\pi r*2)}-m_{h}r^{2}$$

1. I solidified the relationships between linear and angular quantities, and converting between them. Additionally, working out how the sum of the torques works out
2. I was initially confused working through this because  we initially had much higher moment of inertia, which was due to using radius instead of circumference - upon resolving this, it makes a whole lot more sense, and the numbers worked out.
