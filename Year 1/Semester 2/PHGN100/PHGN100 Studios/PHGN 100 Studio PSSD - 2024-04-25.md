## Part (a): $x$ and $y$ components of $\vec{r}_{12}$

$$r_{1x}= \vec{r}_{1}*\sin(\theta)$$
$$r_{1y}= \vec{r}_{1}*\cos(\theta)$$
$$r_{12,x}= x_{2}- (r_{1}*\sin(\theta))$$
$$r_{12,y}= y_{2}- (r_{1}*\cos(\theta))$$

$$|\vec{r}_{12}| = \sqrt{((x_{2}- (r_{1}*\sin(\theta)))^{2} + (y_{2}-(r_{1}*\cos(\theta)))^{2})} $$
## Part (b) $g_{x}$ and $g_{y}$ of gravitational field

$$g_{x} = - G \frac{(m_{1})}{(\sqrt{((x_{2}- (r_{1}*\sin(\theta)))^{2} + (y_{2}-(r_{1}*\cos(\theta)))^{2})})^{3}}*x $$
$$g_{y} = - G \frac{(m_{1})}{(\sqrt{((x_{2}- (r_{1}*\sin(\theta)))^{2} + (y_{2}-(r_{1}*\cos(\theta)))^{2})})^{3}}*y $$


## Part (c) $F_{Gx}$ and $F_{Gy}$ of gravitational force 
I mean, I could copy paste the $g_{x}$ over if you want, but, like, you get the point.
$$F_{Gx}= -g_{x}* m_{2}$$
$$F_{Gy }= -g_{y}*m_{2}$$

## Follow Up Questions
- I solidified the relationship between gravitational fields and gravitational forces - where the force is really just adding in the other mass, and... now the whole 9.81 m/s^2 thing makes sense.
- I'm still a smidge confused about how the magnitude ends up in the bottom cubed, but I also think I may have just misunderstood lecture and been operating under the wrong understanding.
