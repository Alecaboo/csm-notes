## methods of torque

Force * Radius* $\sin(\theta)$
Force * (radius perpendicular to force)
Radius * (force perpendicular to radius)
Cross product of $R\times F$

1. 
$10^6 *1.87 * \sin ( 32 \deg)$
2. 
$-(10^6 *1.87 * \sin ( 32 \deg))*2400$
3.
$$2.6 -1.4 +0$$
$$-1.34 -0.85 -+0$$
4.
1500 * cos( 34 deg)


$$\sin(90+39)=0.777$$$
$$\tau = r*f*\sin(\theta)$$

## torque for rocket 1

- In order to find the torque of rocket 1, I would simply take the $\sum\limits$ of all the other torques (as we want the sum of the torques to be 0 as per N2LR), and then depending on if the resultant sum is positive or negative, the rocket is either going to push or pull. To determine the thrust, you would have to do some additional shenanigans with thrust and dividing by radius, but that's not our concern.
