## usable quantities
$$m_{c}\text{ mass child}$$
$$m_{m}\text {mass merry go-round}$$
$$R \text{ radius merry go round}$$
$$m_{s} \text{, mass scoop, } v_{s~i} \text{, velocity scoop}$$
$$t_{f}, \text{ time final}$$

System is child + merry go round + ice cream
Positive is the direction of the ice cream scoop. 

$$L = R *p$$
$$L = R *m_{s} *v_{s~i}$$
$$\omega = \frac{L}{I}$$
$$I = (\frac{1}{2} m_{m} R^{2} + (m_{c}+m_{s})R^{2} )$$
$$\omega = \frac{R * m_{s}* v_{s~i}}{\left(\frac{1}{2}m_{m}R^{2}\right)+ (m_{c}+ m_{s})R^{2}}$$

$$\omega = \frac{m_{s}* v_{s~i}}{\left(\frac{1}{2}m_{m}R\right)+ (m_{c}+m_{s})R}$$

$$\alpha = \frac{\Delta\omega}{t_{f}}$$
$$\alpha = a R$$
$$a = \frac{F}{m}$$
$$\frac{FR}{m}= \alpha$$
$$F = \alpha \frac{m}{R}$$
$$F = \left(\frac{\Delta\omega}{t_{f}}\right) \frac{m}{R}$$
$$F = \left(\frac{\frac{m_{s}* v_{s~i}}{\left(\frac{1}{2}m_{m}R\right)+ (m_{c}+m_{s})R}}{t_{f}}\right) \frac{m}{R} $$

Linear momentum does not change during the collision - the system given encapsulates everything in the problem, so during the collision linear momentum is conserved.

1. We learned about the conservation of momentum and the relationship between angular and linear quantities.
2. I'm still confused about the absolute cannon of an arm that this ice cream truck driver has - beyond that, I found the entire moment of inertia shenanigans a tad confusing - did we need to account for the point mass of the scoop + child? But like, seriously, how fast did this man throw this?
