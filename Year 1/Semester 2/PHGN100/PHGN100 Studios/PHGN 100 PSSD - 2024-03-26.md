![[Skier on ramp]]

Initial system is just the skier, coordinate system is standard positive x to the right and positive y being up 

### Part 1:
- Using that energy is constant unless work is applied, 
- Initial energy of the skiier = $m_{s}*g*h$
- Friction is negligible and she is not rotating, so the only change in energy is purely to kinetic, meaning $$m_{s}gh = \frac{1}{2}m_{s}v^{2}$$
$$gh = \frac{1}{2}v^{2}, v = \sqrt{2gh}$$
### Part 2:
- Similarly, the only change in energy (for the skiier) will be from kinetic to thermal, and the snow already has an {effective, in this case, as we're considering it} energy of zero, so the thermal energy of skier + snow = $m_{s}gh$ 

## Part 3:

For a rotational object that's rolling without slipping, $$v_{f}= \sqrt{\frac{2g(y_{i}-y_{f})}{(1+c)}}$$ (from discussion yesterday, derived through some mild shenanigans)

$$v_{f,snow} = \sqrt{\frac{2g(h)}{(1 + I_{b})}}$$

So at the bottom of the hill, is

$$v_{f,snow} = ^{?} v_{ski}$$
$$\sqrt{\frac{2gh}{(1 + 0.4)}} =^{?}  \sqrt{2gh}$$
$$1 =^{?} \frac{1}{1.4}$$
Uh, no.
The snowball does not run over the skier - using our equations derived from energy, we can pretty easily determine that at any given point, the skier is moving faster than the ball. This makes sense, as they have the same initial starting energy (the same $h$ and gravitational potential energy), but the snowball is "wasting" energy by rolling, instead of sliding right down like the skier.

### Follow Up Questions
- Solidified the relationships between different kinds of energy - especially with proper system choice, it's pretty straightforward to account for all the energy.
- Curious what the other method to calculate the change in thermal energy of skier + snow was - was it possible to calculate the friction, and then use that to determine how much the thermal energy changed? That seems so much more complicated as to be barely worth mentioning.
