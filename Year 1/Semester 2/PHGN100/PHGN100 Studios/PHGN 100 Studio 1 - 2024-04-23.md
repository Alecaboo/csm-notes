Writing out some equations (from the board)

$$m_{tot}= \int dm$$
$$I = \int dI$$
$$r_{cm}=\frac{1}{m_{tot}} \int r_{cm,dm}dm$$
$$dm = \lambda dl, \text{where } ~ \lambda = \frac{kg}{m}$$
$$dm = o, \text{ where o }$$

$$dm = \lambda dx$$
$$\lambda = \frac{kg}{m}$$
$$I = mr^{2}$$
$$I = (\lambda dx ) *x^{2}$$
$$\int_{0}^{L} (\lambda dx)x^{2} $$
$$\lambda \int_{0}^{L}x^{2}dx$$
$$\lambda * \frac{x^{3}}{3}$$
$$(\lambda \frac{(L)^{3}}{3})$$

- Wow! The equations match what's on the equation sheet (except for the fact that we didn't simplify, but that's beside the point). In order to get the moment of inertia about the end, you would need to muck about with some constants (although your integral bounds would remain the same).
