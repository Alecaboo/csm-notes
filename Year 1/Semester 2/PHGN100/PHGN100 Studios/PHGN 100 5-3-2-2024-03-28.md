![[Enchilada Sketch 2]]
- System is both blocks, the pulley, the wall  (& the spring), the Earth, the floor (which is arguably part of the wall, but, y'know)
	- Definitely NOT including ourselves, because.... we dunno how to figure out that potential energy

#### total work
- $$W_{\vec{F}_{Y1}}=F*\cos(\theta)*d$$
#### kinetic energy
$$0.5m_{1}v_{1}^{2}+ 0.5m_{2}v_{2}^{2}$$

#### Rotational Kinetic
$$\Delta K _{r,sys} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)I_{p}\omega^{2}_{p,f}$$
$$\omega= \frac{v_{2f}}{R_{2}}$$
$$\frac{1}{2}I (\frac{v_{2f}}{R_{2}})^{2}$$
#### Thermal
$$f_{k}= (m_{1}* g + F_{Y1}\sin(\theta))*\mu_{k}* d$$
#### Spring
$$\Delta spring = 0.5*k*d^{2}$$
#### GPE
- You can just relate the radii, so $$\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}*d = \Delta y$$
#### Velocity Shenanigans

$$\omega = \frac{v_{1}}{R_{1}} , \omega = \frac{v_{2}}{R_{2}} $$
$$\frac{v_{1}}{R_{1}}= \frac{v_{2}}{R_{2}}$$
$$v_{1}= \frac{v_{2}R_{1}}{R_{2}}$$

## $v_{2}f$
$$\Delta W_{tot}= F\cos(\theta)d$$
$$\Delta W_{tot}= (0.5m_{1}(v_{2}* \frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}})^{2}+ 0.5m_{2}v_{2}^{2}) +  \frac{1}{2}I (\frac{v_{2f}}{R_{2}})^{2} +   $$
$$((m_{1}* g + F_{Y1}\sin(\theta))*\mu_{k}* d)+ ( 0.5*k*d^{2}) + ( \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}*d*-m_{2}g)$$
---
$$F\cos(\theta) - (0.5 * k *d^{2}) - ((m_{1}*g + F_{Y1}\sin(\theta))*\mu_{k}*d ) - (\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}*d*-m_{2}g)$$
$$= \frac{1}{2}m_{1}(v_{2} \frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}})^{2}+ \frac{1}{2} m_{2}v_{2}^{2} + \frac{1}{2}I (\frac{v_{2}}{R_{1}})^{2}$$
$$= \frac{1}{2}( m_{1}(v_{2}\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}})^{2} + m_{2}v_{2}^{2}+ I ( \frac{ v_{2}}{R_{1}})^{2}) $$
$$= \frac{1}{2}(m_{1} v_{2}^{2}( \frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}})^{2} + m_{2}v_{2}^{2}+ I v^{2}_{2} (\frac{1}{R_{1}})^{2})$$
$$= \frac{1}{2}v_{2}^{2}( m_{1}(\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}})^{2} + m_{2}+ I ( \frac{1}{R_{1}})^{2})$$
$$v_{2}=\sqrt{\frac{2( F\cos(\theta)-0.5*k*d^{2}- (m_{1}*g*F_{Y1}\sin(\theta))*\mu_{k}*d ) - ( \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}})*d*-m_{2}g}{m_{1}( \frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}})^{2} + m_{2}+ I ( \frac{1}{R_{1}})^{2}}}$$
$$\text{Well, that was fun.}$$
$$\cancel{\text{not}}$$

### follow up questions
- Solidified that when you expand your system enough, you actually able to calculate all of the changes in energy, and therefore relate them to work and applied force.
- Most difficult was definitely the final algebra putting everything together - it wasn't even anything particularly complex, there was just an awful lot of terms and values floating around, and I'm still not entirely certain that we got everything
