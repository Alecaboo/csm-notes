System is ball. 

Up is the positive y direction, right is positive x but we don't care about that.

Largely using conservation of energy and the definition of centripetal acceleration.

A) 
![[Swingy Ball FBD (tension bait)]]
No tension
B) The string is still not doing anything in the threshold case - it's not a rigid bar, and can't really exert a force that way at all. 
Same FBD, because.... nothing changed

$$a_{c}m_{b}= gm_{b} \text{(because that's the only force acting)}$$
$$a_{c}= \frac{v^{2}}{ R}$$


$$g = \frac{v^{2}}{r}$$$$v= \sqrt{gr}$$

d. 

$$\left(\frac{1}{2}m_{b} v^{2}+ m_{b}g(L-R)\right)= m_{b}g L $$
sum of energy, might be wrong

$$W = d\vec{s}\int mg = $$

$$d\vec{s} = ( \frac{1}{2}\pi L)) + (\pi r)$$
$$W =  (L-2R)*mg*t $$

Change in energy should be nothing

So the relationship betwene L and R is $$L = 2R$$
$$\frac{L}{R}= 2 \text{ in the threshold}$$

e) Yep, checks out.



1. Solidified the importance of centripetal acceleration, and its usages in solving more problems, as all of physics continues to build on itself.
2. Still a smidge confused about why we don't care about the x displacement at all -isn't the tension doing a lot of shenanigans between the beginning and the end? Or is it a conservative force (gravity), so we only care about the endpoints?
