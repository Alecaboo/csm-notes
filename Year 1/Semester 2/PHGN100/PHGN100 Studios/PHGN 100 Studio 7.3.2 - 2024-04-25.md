$$-G \frac{M}{(R^{2}+h^{2})^{3}}h$$

### Symmetry One
- The field should be pulling down on the mass - everything is symmetrical about the center, so everything but $z$ will cancel.

### Symmetry Two
- Yes, I understand this argument - I just made it about a sentence ago.

### Symmetry Three
- Yeah, this makes sense to me. That's what our equation worked out to for the first part, and all the component giving the exact same contribution is a little funny.

### Symmetry Final
- With the 1st and third being the same, and 2nd and fourth, yes, you can still use symmetry. The relevant components will cancel out, because they are symmetrical about the center
- With the 1st and 2nd being the same however, you cannot use symmetry. Unless $\lambda_{1}$ and $\lambda_{2}$ are the same, there will be an unequal force of attraction in the $x$ and $y$ directions, meaning symmetry is invalid.
