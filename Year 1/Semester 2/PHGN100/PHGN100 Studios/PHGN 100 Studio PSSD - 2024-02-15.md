$$a_{c} = f_{s}\sin(\theta) + N_{RB}\cos(\theta)$$
$$\frac{v^{2}}{r}= f_{s}\sin(\theta) + N_{RB}\cos(\theta)$$
$$0 = \vec{N}_{RB}\sin(\theta)+\vec{W}_{EB}$$
$$N_{RB} = - \frac{W_{EB}}{\sin(\theta)}$$
$$\frac{v^{2}}{r} * m_{B}= f_{s,RB}\sin(\theta) + ( \frac{W_{EB}}{\sin(\theta)})\cos(\theta)$$
$$\frac{v^{2}}{r}m_{B}= f_{s,RB}\sin(\theta) + gm_{b}\cot(\theta)$$
$$\frac{v^{2}}{r}m_{B} - gm_{B}\cot(\theta ) = f_{s,RB}\cos(\theta)$$
$$m_{B}\frac{ \frac{v^{2}}{r} - g\cot(\theta)}{\sin(\theta)} = f_{s,RB}$$

### Questions
1. I learned the importance of setting your axes properly, and considering all the components that forces break into when you consider them along those axis. 
2. I'm still a little confused as to how the geometry works out to be $\sin$ instead of $\cos$, but that's just me needing to review my geometry in order to break shapes at weird angles apart.
