We're using the relationship between Force and energy here

System is object b 

$$U_{\vec{F}_{ab}}(x) = Ax + \frac{B}{x}$$

![[Potential Energy Graph]]
1.
$$F_{ab} = -\frac{d}{dx}U_{F_{AB}}$$
$$F_{ab}= -A + \frac{B}{x^{2}}$$
2. The values of x are going to be the turning points - the corners on our graph\
	1. Equilibrium position is going to be $\sqrt{\frac{B}{A}}$
2. ![[Turning Points]]
3. The positive x equilibrium position is stable, meanwhile the negative x position is unstable
4. a

$$\Delta KE = \int F_{AB}$$
$$\int F_{AB} = U_{F_{AB}}=Ax + \frac{B}{x}$$
$$\frac{1}{2}m_{b}v^{2}= Ax + \frac{B}{x}$$
$$v^{2}= \frac{Ax+ \frac{B}{x}}{\frac{1}{2}m}$$
$$v = \sqrt{\frac{2(Ax + \frac{B}{x})}{m_{b}}}$$

1. Learned about the relationship between potential energy and force (and to an extent, kinetic energy and force, assuming we didn't horrifically mess up the speed)
	1. We might've horrifically messed up the speed.
2. Still confused if the equilibrium points are really that simple - is it just solving that equation?
