- look, it's way better than any sketch I could make
- System is ball, up is the positive y direction

- $$W = F_{cb}$$
- $$((d+L_{0})-L_{0})k = F_{cb}$$
- $$(d)k = mg$$
- $$k = \frac{mg}{d}$$

We already found the velocity function in terms of time, so all we would have to do is take the derivative of the velocity function.
