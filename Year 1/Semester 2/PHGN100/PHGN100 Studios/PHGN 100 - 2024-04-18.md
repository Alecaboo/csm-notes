$$U_{g}= mgy$$
$$U_{x}= mg * y(x)$$
$$y(x) = y_{0}( \frac{x}{x_{0}} )^{2}e^{-x/x_{0}}$$
$$U(x) = mg * (y_{0}* (\frac{x}{x_{0}})^{2})e^{-x/x_{0}}$$

Student A is correct - even though the motion and everything else is changing, there is still only one relevant force acting in the situation - so they can be viewed as functionally being the same.
