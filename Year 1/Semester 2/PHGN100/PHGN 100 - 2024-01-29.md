[[PHGN100 - Block One]]

## honestly just lots of notation shit
- The vector $\vec{F}_{\text{ba}}$  is the force of b on a
- 2nd subscript is a the thing being acted on
- Objects do not need to be in contact


#### more notation
- Gravity (mostly in celestial body contexts) $\vec{F}_{G,Eb}$
- Weight on earth also just gets $\vec{W}_{Eb}$
	- Weight is always directed down
- We've got springs, $\vec{F}_{sp,ab}$
- Normal force, $\vec{N}_{TB}$
- $\vec{f}_{s,TB}$ static friction
	- vs...
- $\vec{f}_{k,TB}$ kinetic friction
- and finally tension, $\vec{T}_{SB}$
### things that are definitively not forces
- Velocity
- Inertia is also not a force
	- tendency to not accelerate, but not a force
- Pressure
	- that's a force per area
- Centripetal acceleration
- Torque
- Centrifugal is also not real. 
	- Fakers.

## newton's laws (just to have them, ig)
1. In an intertial reference frame, an object will move with a constant velocity unless acted upon by a net external force
2. The acceleration of a system is proportional to the net external force and inversely proportional to its inertial mass
	1. There's some icky math I don't really want to write
	2. $\vec{a}_{b}=\frac{\sum\limits_{f}\vec{F}_{jb}}{m_{b}}$ 
3. If object $a$ exerts a force on another object $b$, there is an equal and opposite force acting from object $b$ on object $a$
	1. $\vec{F}_{ab}=-\vec{F}_{ba}$
	2. or $F_{ab}=F_{ba}$
	3. Hand on forehead, forehead on hand
4.

he had WAY too much fun with this
- we got sesame street'd
- is 2 the same as 3? no! is normal the same as gravitational? still no
