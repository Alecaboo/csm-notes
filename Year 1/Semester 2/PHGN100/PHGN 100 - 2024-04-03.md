- Long, long chat about the center of mass not changing between ie two interacting planets


## we've got three kinds of collisions!
- perfectly elastic collision
	- kinetic energy remains constant before and after the collision
- perfectly inelastic collision
	- They smack together and move off happily ever after
- inelastic
	- they crunch, munch a bit, and then KE is not the same

- If time or external forces are particularly small, you can say momentum is constant 

$$5 \sin(\theta)=3, \theta = 36.67\degree$$

$$v_{sf,x} - v_{1f,x} = v_{1i,x}-v_{2i,x}$$
