### Advanced gravitation (yippee)

$$\vec{F}_{21}= -G \frac{m_{2}m_{1}}{r_{21}^{2}}\hat{r}_{21}$$
Alternatively, if you're too lazy to get a unit vector

$$\vec{F}_{21} = -G \frac{m_{2}m_{1}}{r_{21}^{3}}\vec{r}_{21}$$

Little g, though

$$\vec{g}(\vec{r}_{1})= - \sum\limits_{k=2}^{N} G \frac{m_{k}}{r_{k1}{^{2}}}$$

#### alright alright, wtf is going on with gravity?
- what the hell is mass?
	- Is it the relationship between force and acceleration (ie $F=ma$)?
	- The property that determines the gravitational force?
- Is it a force, an acceleration, some wibbly wobbly timey-wimey stuff?
- Why does gravity only pull?
- Why is it such a lil baby force?




- Basic idea of a gravitational field: gravity influences the entire universe (just.... very very small, past most points)
