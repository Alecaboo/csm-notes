## 1-4 advanced kinematics
- for an object with piecewise acceleration, figure out where tf it is
- use kinematics in "chase" style problems
- average vector quantities 
	- with difference, both vector and graphical
	- and integrals!
- more integral shit


- Using a definite integral to $t$ is a wonderful way of getting an equation while still cheating the $+C$


### piecewise fella
- From $t_{1}$ to $t_{2}$, $a_{A}(t)$ , from time $t_{2}$ to $t_{3}$, $a_{B}(t)$
- Given some $v_{x}(t_{1})$, how fast is it moving at $t_{3}$? $v_{x}(t_{3})=$ ?
- $v_{x}(t_{3})=v_{x}(t_{1})+\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}a_{A,x}(t)dt +\int_{t_{2}}^{t_{3}}a_{B,x}(t')dt'$
	- So our final velocity is the initial velocity, + the final velocity of the first segment, and finally smacking the final change in velocity at the end


time for....
### the chase

Given $v_{car,x}(t)$ and $v_{moto,x}(t)$, two vehicles reach the same final position at the same time
$v_{car,x}(t)\neq v_{moto,x}(t)$
How far apart were they initially

- We can just go round and round and integrate velocities to get displacement and all that fun stuff
$$x_{car}(t_{i)+}\int_{t_i}^{t_{f}}v_{car,x}(t)dt=x_{moto}(t_{i}) + \int_{t_{i}}^{t^{f}}v_{moto,x}(t)dt$$

- I love the amount of physics questions where the answer is "we don't care!"
	- Why didn't we solve for acceleration here? We don't give a fuck!
- Displacement and average velocity have the same sign, because like, how in the world would you end up along the other direction
