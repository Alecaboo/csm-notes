- Linear approximation
	- Given $f(x)=e^{1-x}$
	- Approximate this with a linear function centered at $x=1$
		- SO the slope, $f'(x)= -e^{1-x}$
		- $f'(1)=-e^{0}=-1$
		- 
- Quadratic Approximation
- Polynomial Approximation
	- Taylor polynomials
- 
point
$$(1,f(1)) = (1,1)$$
$$y - f(1) = f'(1)(x-1)$$
$$L(x) = 2-x \approx e^{1-x}$$
Most accurate for $x$ near 1

Lettuce approximate $e^\frac{1}{4}$
Evaluate L at $\frac{3}{4}$, so then we get L = $\frac{5}{4}$, which has an error of $0.034025$
