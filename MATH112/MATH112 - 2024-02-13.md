(& pumping shit)



#### gravity with work
- work = $mass*g*distance$
	- metric might have mass and you need to multiply, imperial is just generally the weight

- Find work required required to lift a 70lb bucket 60ft using a rope of density $\rho=0.5 lb/ft$ 
	- we got a 70lb force, going a distance of 60ft, $70*60=4200ft*lb$
	- Now, to find the work required for the rope, we're going to do an integral for each little section of rope
		- $$w_{rope}=0.5\Delta y$$
		- To move from position $y_{k}$ to the top, that'll be ($60-y_{k}$ft)
		- Work $\approx 0.5\Delta y(60-y_{k})$
		- Overall work is the summation from 1 to n as all that
		- $$\int_{0}^{60}0.5(60-y)dy$$
		- This is the work required to move the rope
		- $0.5 \int_{0}^{60}60-y$
		- $0.5(60y \frac{-y^{2}}{2})$
			- from 0 to 60
		- so that's 900 ft-lbs
	- bucket + rope = $5100$ ftlbs
- what if we moved only 40 ft?
	- the bucket and 20ft of rope go up 40ft
		- We can do that easy squeazy, just treat it as one single object
			- So that's just (70+10)40 = 3200 ftlbs
	- the rest of the rope do some integral shenanigans
	- $\int_{20}^{60}0.5(60-y)dy=400ftlbs$

### pumping problems
###### megan? that you?
- how much work is required to pump water out of a tank?
- ![[Tank Sketch]]
- okie dokie, so we have some tank
- let's say y=0 is the bottom of the tank
	- and y=b is the top
- And let's say $y=h$ is where the water is leaving
- Let's start by looking at a cross section
	- We want the area of the cross section
	- Say we're at some height $y_{k}$, we want $A(y_{k})$, area of a cross section at $y=y_{k}$
- Total volume is just $V_{k}=A(y_{k})\Delta y$  for the volume of some kth layer
	- $F_{k}=V_{k}*\rho (kg/m^{3})$
		- (water is 1000 kg/m^3, because we uh, used it to define that)
	- $w_{k}\approx F_{k}(h-y_{k})$
	- $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n}A(y_{k})\Delta y\rho g(h-y_{k})$
	- $\int_{0}^{b}A(y)\rho g (h-y)dy$
	-
