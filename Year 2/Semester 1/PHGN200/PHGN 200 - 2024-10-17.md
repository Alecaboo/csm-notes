### Ok, so like, what do magnetic fields *do?*
- Like, we can calculate them, but one of the things they can do is exert forces on moving charges
$$\vec{F}_{\text{mag}}= q\vec{v}\times \vec{B}$$
- There's a couple fairly interesting conclusions to be drawn from this
	- If there's no charge, there's no force
	- If said charge has no velocity, there's no force
	- If the velocity is parallel to the magnetic field, there is *also* no force.
- Whole pile of clickers I probably should've written down, but my general takeaway was pay attention to your right hand rule and the charges involved.

### Cyclotron Cases
1. $\vec{V} \perp \vec{B}$ actually produces circular motion
2. $\vec{V} \parallel \vec{B}$ is going to do all of fuck all. Magnets don't do jack shit.
3. $\vec{V}$ is neither $\parallel$ or $\perp$, you have what we call a problem.
	1. It's actually a helix, it ends up spiraling around some center line.

##### Cyclotron Examples
- For a charge $q$ and mass $m$ traveling with speed $v$, what is the cyclotron frequency in a magnetic field with magnitude $B$
	- We're expecting circular motion, where $a_{c}= \frac{v^{2}}{r}$
	- And circular motion is that $F_{b}= \frac{mv^{2}}{r}$ 
	- We set our forces equal, where $mv_{r}= qBr$
	- and $v_{t}=\omega r$ 
	- $m\omega r = qBr -> \omega \frac{qB}{m}-> f = \frac{\omega}{2\pi}= \frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{qB}{m}$ 
### Magnetic Force on a Current-carrying Wire
- So, using the good ol' drift velocity equation, and our new magnetic force equation, we get some shenanigans along the lines of $\vec{F_{B}}=q\vec{v}\times \vec{B}=> Q\vec{v}\times\vec{B}$, where $Q=nqA\ell$, so $\vec{F_{b}}=nqa\ell \vec{v}\times\vec{B}$
- Which, where $I = nqAv_{d}$ means that $\vec{F_{b}}=I\vec{\ell}\times\vec{B}$
- We, quite annoyingly, often end up integrating over this, where $d\vec{F}= I d\vec{\ell}\times\vec{B}$

##### Example problem (attempt)
- $Rd\theta I \times B_{0}$? maybe
- wrong, actually, it's $d\vec{\ell}=Rd\theta( - \sin\theta \hat\imath + \cos\theta \hat\jmath)$ 
- which then gives $\vec{B} = B_{0}\hat{k}$ 
- So the cross product of $Rd\theta (-\sin\theta\hat{\imath}+ \cos\theta \hat\jmath) \times B_{0}\hat{k}$
- $= (\cos\theta\hat{\jmath}Rd\theta * B_{0})\hat{\imath} + (Rd\theta\sin\theta)B_{0}\hat{\jmath} + 0\hat{k}$
- $$B_{0}Rd\theta( \cos\theta \hat{\imath} + \sin\theta\hat{\jmath})$$
$$= IB_{0}R \int(\cos\theta \hat\imath + \sin\theta \hat{\jmath})d\theta $$
