### housekeeping stuff
- Section D (I'm going to forget)

#### general course outline
- electrostatics, circuits, magnetcs, electromagnetism

## actual physics  (that took twelve minutes)
#### some general basic facts
- we've identified two types of charges (positive and negative)
- two negative charges next to each other are going to repel
- opposites attract, etc, etc
- that will get you *shockingly* far 
	- ba dum tiss
- Electrons have a charge of $q = -e = -1.602\times 10^{-19}C$
- Protons, on the other hand, have $q=e=1.602\times 10^{19}C$
	- That's on the equation sheet, don't need to memorize, but is fun regardless
- Moving charges is generally moving electrons, because they're comically light
- Charges are conserved in a closed system
	- Also quantized: you could count it, it'll exclusively be whole units of $e$

##### matter! (it does)
- insulators and conductors
	- charges in insulators can't move and are "fixed"
		- well, that's not really true, they can move a *little bit,* but not really
			- ie, if a charged object with positive charge would be nearby, the protons would *slightly* sneak away
	- conductors, meanwhile, are having a grand old time
		- protons and electrons are floating in a soup, and super movable
		- if that same positively charged object were to be brought near a conductor, protons would scramble as far away as they could, and electrons would huddle in like the sheep they are

#### physics, never change (five part example problem)
- starting with a big, positively charged sphere and two little spheres that are far away
2. Gambling that charges are going to move over and polarize
3. Ok little sphere A is going to be negative, little sphere B is going to be positive (because now they're going to swippy swappy charges around, because now they're essentially one big object)
4. After they were touching if they bring them apart, they'll keep having their charges, even if moved away from the big sphere

## ok back to housekeeping ig
- If you answer 75% of the clicker questions, that counts for the whole day
- 2% extra credit exists, so that's nice
- Exclusively whole letter grades from .00 to 9.99
- Six total quizzes (three free response, three traditional {with questions taken from the homework and studio})
	- Only five are counted towards your grade (neat)
- Quizzes have some curve shenanigans going on
	- If version A had an average of 80%, B of 75%, and C of 75%, B and C will get normalized up to 80% so you're not punished for having a harder quiz
- Nothing on a quiz that you've never seen before (exclusively from homework, discussion, or studio) (same for the final)

# toDo
- read everything on canvas
- note logistic questions
- make sure you can access webwork
- have clicker be ready
