## Continuous Charge Distribution
So, we know that the field due to *one* charge is our $\vec{E} = \frac{kQ}{r^{3}}\vec{r}$
Because $\vec{E}$ is a vector, the electric due to a whole bunch is $\sum\limits_{i}\frac{kQ_{i}}{r^{3}_{i}}\vec{r}_{i}$, which is, again, known
If we have a ton of tiny charges though, we move to an integral

$$\vec{E} = \int \frac{k dQ}{r^{3}}\vec{r}_{i}$$
$$\vec{F_{e}}= q \int \frac{kdQ}{r^{3}}\vec{r}$$
 - Our $dQ$ is a very very very small chunk of something - it does *not* mean that it's changing, just that it's very small
	 - Derivatives are ratios of infinitesimals, for fun reference
 - Hey, so, we kinda need to know what's going on with $dQ$ 
	 - For one dimension (lines of stuff), 
	 - $$dQ=\lambda dl$$$$\lambda = \frac{Q_{total}}{L_{total}}$$
	 - Two dimensions though
	 $$dq = \sigma dA$$$$\sigma = \frac{Q_{total}}{A_{total}}$$ - Finally, wrapping out in three dimensions

$$dQ = \rho d V$$
$$\rho = \frac{Q_{total}}{V_{total}}$$

- Ok, sure, the arc is one dimensional. Sure.

$$dQ = \lambda * Rd\theta$$
$$\lambda = \frac{Q_{total}}{L_{total}}$$
$$dQ = (\frac{Q_{total}}{\pi R}) *Rd\theta$$
$$dQ = \frac{Qd\theta}{\pi}$$
---

A circle with charge density $\lambda$ and radius $r$ would spit out a $dQ$ of $dQ = \lambda rd\theta$\

- Draw sketch, label dq, do algebra, etc, etc

$$\vec{E}=\int \frac{kdQ}{r^{3}}\vec{r}$$
$$dQ = \lambda * d\ell$$
$$\lambda = \frac{Q}{L}$$
$$d\ell = dx$$
$$dQ = \frac{Q}{L}*dx$$

- The overwhelming majority of the time it's really convenient to make cartesian coordinates, ie $$\vec{r} = r_{x}(\hat\imath) + r_{y}(\hat\jmath) + r_{z}(\hat{k})$$
