### Faraday's Law
- The magnitude of emf (voltage) induced in a conducting loop is equal to the rate at which the magnetic flux through that loop changes with time. 
$$\epsilon = \frac{d\Phi_{B}}{dt}= \frac{-d}{dt}\int \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{A}= - \frac{d}{dt}\int \vec{B} * \cos\theta * d\vec{A}$$
### Lenz's Law
- An induced current has a direction such that the magnetic field due to the current opposes the change in the magnetic flux that induces that current.

### How to find the direction of current
1. Decide if Flux is increasing or decreasing
2. Recognize that the induced B-field will change the flux in the *opposite* way
3. Use the right hand rule to find the direction of the current that will produce the induced B-field from 2
	   For that right hand rule bit:
		   1. Curl your fingers around said loop
		   2. Your thumb will point in the direction of the magnetic field

# Big Note: Nature hates changes in flux!
- this means that most of the time we're somehow keeping flux constant. Nature *HATES* changes in flux.
## Finding EMF
#### If we have a loop
Use the one earlier of $$\Phi_{B}= \int\vec{B} \cdot d \vec{A}$$
#### If you do not have a loop
$$|\epsilon| = |\Delta V| = \int\vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l}$$
$$\vec{F}_{E}= q\vec{E}, F_{B} \text{ yadayada I lost it.}$$

#### example attempt
$$B\cos(\omega * t)* \pi a^{2}$$

$$\Phi_{B}= \vec{B} \cdot \vec{A} = -B(\pi a^{2})\cos(\omega t)$$
$$|\epsilon| = \frac{d\Phi_{B}}{dt}= \frac{d}{dt}(-B(\pi a^{2})\cos(\omega t))= \omega B(\pi a^{2})\sin(\omega t)$$
$$\epsilon = IR \to I = \frac{\epsilon}{R}= \frac{\omega B (\pi a^{2})\sin(\omega t)}{R} $$
- They just asked for the magnitude is where the negative goes

---
- A square of current of length L moves into a region with a B-field of magntitude B. What voltage is induced in the loop
$$\epsilon = BLv$$
- Direction is going to be out of the page, due to CCW current.

### Eddy Currents
- If you have plates of conductive material as opposed to loops of wire, we get neat little eddies of electrons that cause a braking force
