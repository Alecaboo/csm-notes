## Powah
- Power is energy over time, or $P = \frac{\Delta U}{\Delta t}$
- Power is also $P=\Delta V I$
- Units are watts, also known as Joules / second. You do some dimensional analysis to get there, it works out, I swear.
- We can also do some Ohm's Law shenanigans to go more
	- $P = \Delta VI = I^{2}R = \frac{\Delta V^{2}}{R}$

#### example (it's a circuit with one R in series and the other two in parallel)
- Total resistance is $\frac{3}{2}R$
- $V= IR$
	- $I=\frac{V}{\frac{3R}{2}}, I= \frac{2V}{3R}$
	- $P=\frac{2V^{2}}{3R}$

## Suffering with Resistors
- For most things, you can just use $R = \frac{\rho L}{A}$
	- Where $\rho$ is the resistivity, L is the length, A is the cross sectional area
	- A varying $\rho$ or A would use $dR = \frac{\rho dL}{A}$

#### Resistance over a non-uniform object
- Square wire of length L that starts at x=0, the width of the wire is given by $S=4+3x$. Total resistance is $$\int_{0}^{L}\frac{\rho dx}{(4+3x)^{2}}$$

## Kirchhoff's Rules
#### Junction Rule
- Comes from conservation of charge
- Sum of the currents into a junction must equal the sum of currents *out* of the junction.
	- The formal math for this is something like $\sum\limits I_{in}= \sum\limits I_{out}$, which feels obvious but like, thanks Kirchhoff, I guess.
#### Loop Rule
- Conservation of Energy shenanigans
- If you go around *any* closed loop in a circuit, the sum of the changes in potential must equal zero. 
#### Sign Conventions
- Going opposite the direction of current flow, resistor would be positive, and battery would be negative.
	- This is going from the negative terminal to the positive terminal.
- Going with the current flow, the battery is going to be positive, and resistor will be negative.

-  huge shoutout to a guy muttering "thanks a lot ben franklin"
![[kirchhoff's circuit sketch]]
- Top junction we have that $I_{1}= I_{2}+ I_{3}$
- One on the bottom we have $I_{2}+ I_{3}= I_{1}$
- Outer Loop
	- $V -IR_{1}-I_{3}R_{3}=0$
- Inner Loop
	- $V -I_{1}R_{1}-I_{2}R_{2}=0$
- Inner Loop 2
	- $I_{3}R_{3}+I_{2}R_{2}=0$
