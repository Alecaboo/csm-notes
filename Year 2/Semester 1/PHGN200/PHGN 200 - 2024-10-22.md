- Electric field in hall effect shenanigans because we need the upward force from the electric field to be balanced from the downward force from the magnetic field, which is just saying $|q\vec{E}| = |q\vec{v}\times\vec{B}| \to E = vB$
- Oh hey, now that we know our electric, field, we can find the voltage difference, $\Delta V = \int\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{l}\approx ED = vBd$
- You only end up with an induced hall voltage when you're not going the same direction as your electric field (airplane example)

## torque time
- this came up in the webwork before in lecture, just for the record
- $\vec{\tau}=\vec{r}\times\vec{F}$, where $\vec{r}$ is the radius from the axis of rotation to the point of application, and $\vec{F}$ is the applied force
- CCW is positive, for convention's sake
### there are two ways:
#### the safe way
- Which is just going to be $\vec{\tau} = \int\vec{r}\times d\vec{F}$ 
	- where $d\vec{F}=Id\vec{l}\times\vec{B}$
#### the less safe way
- This only works with a full loop of current, in this case we can say $\vec{\tau}=\vec{\mu}\times\vec{B}$
	- where $\mu$ is a magnetic moment, defined by $NI\vec{A}$
		- Area vector of a current loop can be found using the right hand rule, ie if you have a counterclockwise loop of current, we can point up and call it good.
		- $\vec{A}$ is the area vector, in that equation
		- $N$ is our number of loops


## Para and Ferro magnetism
- An electron has spin (an intrinsic magnetic moment)
- Paramagnetic materials have net electron spins that are just kind of a crapshoot and are all over the palce
	- Applying a magnetic (B-field) aligns the spins (juuust a little bit), which reinforces the original field (juuuust a little bit)
		- Examples include aluminum, magnesium, and tungsten
- Ferromagnetic materials, on the other hand, have chunks of spin domains
	- When you shove a ferromagnetic material in a big old magnetic field, they end up all facing the same way, doing so at high temperature tends to lock magnets in place
- "Permanent" magnets are made of ferromagnetic materials
