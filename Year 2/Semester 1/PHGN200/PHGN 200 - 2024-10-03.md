Average of the function $V_{0}(\frac{t}{t_{0}})^{2}$ from $t=0$ to $t=t_{0}$ 
$V_{m}= \frac{1}{t_{0}-0} \int_{0}^{t_{0}}V_{0}( \frac{t}{t_{0}})^{2}dt$
$= \frac{V_{0}t^{3}}{3t_{0}^{3}}$

$V_{0}^{2}(\frac{t}{t_{0}})^{4}$
- Blah blah blah, some root mean square stuff (you square the function, do the mean, and then root it) (shit's crazy)

### Most of what we've done so far is DC
- Steady voltage, common in digital electronics

### A lot of other things though use *alternating* current
- Comes out the wall, is oscillating and sine-y and all that other fun stuff
- AC signals get two parameters:
	- Frequency, which is $\omega = 2\pi f$ 
	- We have the ampltiude, either $I_{0}$ or $V_{0}$ 
		- For instance, $V(t) = V_{0}\cos(\omega t)$
- Funny story about resistors:
	- They still work the exact same!
	- Voltage and current are going to be, how you say, uh, fucked up, but resistance is just fine!
	- $V=IR$ still applies, you just gotta plug in your fucked up values
- Capacitors though are morally compromised and refuse to hold to a reasonable standard.
	- With a DC current (low frequency), they prevent current flow, exactly as expected
	- With a high frequency input (read: AC power) the capacitor is going to charge and discharge quickly, dumping current through.
		- This is because it's going to oscillate between being charged and not, so it is somewhere between a straight piece of wire and infinite resistor, so it essentially works as resistor (less straightforward though)
	- The "reactance" of a capacitor, which is essentially the resistance, is represented by X and is represented by $\frac{1}{\omega C}$ 
		- This also uses ohms!
- Unfortunately, voltages across our resistor and our capacitor are not in phase, so we can't just slap them together straight away
	- What we *can* do is add them together in quadrature ie $Z =\sqrt{R^{2}+X^{2}}$, which is the "impedance" of our circuit
$$V_{rms,C}= \frac{V_{rms,in}}{\sqrt{\omega^{2}R^{2}C^{2}+ 1}}$$
	- that shit's fucked up, for the record. I don't like that at *all*

#### exampling or something
- Finding resistance and capacitance
- $$R_{tot}= \frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_{1}}+ \frac{1}{R_{2}}}$$$$C_{tot}= \frac{1}{\frac{1}{C_{1}}+ \frac{1}{C_{2}}}$$$$X = \frac{1}{\omega ( \frac{1}{\frac{1}{C_{1}}+ \frac{1}{C_{2}}})}$$$$X = \frac{1}{\frac{\omega}{\frac{1}{c_{1}}+ \frac{1}{c_{2}}}}$$$$X = \frac{\frac{1}{C_{1}}+ \frac{1}{C_{2}}}{\omega} = \frac{1}{\omega C_{1}}+ \frac{1}{ \omega C_{2}}$$
$$Z = \sqrt{R^{2}+ X^{2}}$$
$$Z = \sqrt{ \left(\frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_{1}}+ \frac{1}{R_{2}}}\right)^{2}+ \left(\frac{1}{\omega C_{1}}+ \frac{1}{\omega C_{2}}\right)^{2}}$$
