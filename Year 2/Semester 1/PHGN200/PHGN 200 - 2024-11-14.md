## Reflection
- When EM radiation hits a surface, some of it will be reflected, at an angle equivalent to the incident angle (ie, comes in at 45 degrees, will go back out at 45 degrees)

#### What is the minimum height of a wall mirror that allows a 4ft tall child to see her entire reflection
![[the cursed child]]
- Alright well that was reflection, the child doesn't care about distance from the mirror.

### Refraction time
- Light travels at a speed less than $c$ going through not empty space.

$$c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_{0}\mu_{0}}}$$
- That's for empty space, but when moving through not empty space, we end up with $$c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\kappa\epsilon_{0}\mu_{0}}}$$
- Where that $\kappa$ is based on the material. $\mu_{0}$ stays the same, because it only really changes for metals, and metals don't exactly let light through.
	- The index of refraction, $n = \frac{c}{v}> 1$ is a thing that exists but like, not really clear what's what.
- What's actually going to change is some part of our $v=\lambda f$, where the frequency of our light is going to stay constant<sub>(due to some mild conservation of energy shenanigans since frequency determines the energy of waves)</sub>, where wavelength is then going to change.
- Some typical indices of refraction
	- Air: $n=1$
	- Water: $n=1.33$
	- Glass: $n=1.5$
- Quirky bit is that $n= \frac{c}{\lambda f}$, which is how you get rainbows and such
- As light goes from one material to the other, it'll refract according to Snell's law, which states that $$n_{1}\sin\theta_{1}= n_{2}\sin\theta_{2}$$
	- Where $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ are properties of the materials, defined by $n=\frac{c}{v}$
- $$1\sin\theta = n_{2}\sin\theta$$
- $$\sin\theta = \frac{\sin\theta_{1}}{n}$$
$$n\arcsin(\frac{\sin_{1}}{n})= \sin\theta_{3}$$
$$\arcsin(n\arcsin(\frac{\sin}{n}))$$
---- 

$$\cos(\theta_{r})= \frac{t}{\ell}, \ell = \frac{t}{\cos(\theta_{r})}$$
$$\sin(\theta-\theta_{r})= \frac{d}{\ell}$$
$$d = \sin(\theta-\theta_{r})* \ell = \sin(\theta- \theta_{r})*\frac{t}{\cos(\theta_{r})}$$

### Total Internal Reflection
- At a critical angle (or greater), all light incident on a surface is completely reflected without losses. We call this total internal reflection

$$\sin\theta_{1}= \frac{4}{3}$$
$$\theta_{1}= \arcsin(\frac{4}{3}) $$
- Which is, uh, not possible? I think?
- TO keep something inside though, we just end up needing $$\theta = \arcsin(1/n_{material})$$
