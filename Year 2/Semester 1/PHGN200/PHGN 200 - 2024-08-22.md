### coulomb's law
- This is for finding the force between two charges, which is equal to $$\vec{F}_{1,2}= \frac{kq_{1}q_{2}}{r^{2}_{1,2}}\hat{r}_{1,2}$$
	- $\hat{r}$ is our unit vector in this situation, which is telling us where we're going
		- normal r down there is just the distance between them
- $$\hat{r} = \frac{\hat{r}}{r}= \frac{r_{x}\hat\imath + r_{y}\hat\jmath + r_{2}\hat{k}}{r}$$
- Any time you're working in more than one dimension, it's generally easier to work using the equation $$=\frac{kq_{1}q_{2}}{r^{3}_{1,2}}\vec{r}_{1,2}$$
- Which, again, is all the same
- $\vec{r}$ is always going to point from cause to effect, so similar to gravity, we would say something like $q_{1}$ is causing $q_{2}$ to experience a force
	- Same notation as in the past, where the force from $q_{1}$ on $q_{2}$ would be $\vec{F}_{1,2}$

Got a charge $q_{1}= 5\micro C$ located at $(1,2,3)$ and charge $q_{2}= -8\micro C$ located at $(4,7,8)$, what is the force exerted by $q_1$ on $q_{2}$
![[phys2 8.22.24 prob1]]

$$F_{1,2}= \frac{Kq_{1}q_{2}}{r^{3}}\vec{r}$$

So just doing the location vectors, the (non unit) vector for direction is going to be $<3,5,5>$, which is fun, so that'll be $\vec{r}_{1,2}$ (if we're being physics with it, they'll probably say $3\hat\imath + 5\hat\jmath + 5\hat{k}$)

$\hat{r}_{1,2}$ though is going to be that divided by $|\vec{r}_{1,2}|$, which is going to be like $\sqrt{59}$, which is... kind of ugly, but whatever, so $\hat{r}_{1,2}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{59}}*(3\hat\imath+5\hat\jmath+5\hat{k})$\
(or like, you could distribute, but.... I'm really lazy. ) (or like, rationalize, but being honest, $\frac{\sqrt{59}}{59}$ isn't exactly more comprehensible)

- You can then plug in and solve, so micro is $10^{-6}$, so it'll be 

### superposition
- The net force (from electrostatics) is the sum of all the individual forces, ie $$\vec{F}_{net}= \sum\limits_{i}\vec{F}_{i}$$
- Three charges are arranged in a whole fashion
- $$\vec{F}_{1,2}= \frac{Kq_{1}q_{2}}{d_{2}^{3}}\vec{r}_{1,2} = \frac{Kq_{1}q_{2}}{d_{2}^{3}}(-d_{2}\hat\jmath)$$$$\vec{F}_{3,2}= \frac{Kq_{3}q_{2}}{d^{3}_{3}}\vec{r}_{3,2}= \frac{Kq_{3}q_{2}}{d_{3}^{3}}(-d_{3}\hat\imath)$$$$\vec{r}_{1,2 }= 0\hat\imath + -d_{2}\hat\jmath + 0 \hat{k}$$
$$\vec{r}_{3,2}= d_{3}\hat\imath + 0\hat\jmath + 0\hat{k}$$
$$\sum\limits \vec{F}_{2}= \vec{F}_{1,2}+ \vec{F}_{3,2}= \frac{Kq_{1}q_{2}}{d_{2}^{3}}(-d_{2}\hat\jmath) + \frac{Kq_{3}q_{2}}{d^{3}_{3}}(-d_{3}\hat\imath)$$

### Electric Field
- Electric fields tell you what would be happening *if* you were to put any charge of your choice at a location in the field
- Has units of Newtons per Coulomb, or $\frac{N}{C}$
- Equations for this are as follows
$$\vec{E}= \frac{kq_{source}}{r^{3}}\vec{r}$$
$$\vec{F}= q\vec{E}$$
- So the "cause" term is still floating in the $\vec{E}$, we just moved the effect outside 


#### Electric Field Lines Rules
- Always begin on positive charges and end on negative charges 
- Lines around isolated charges are symmetrical
- Number of lines around a charge are proportional to the magnitude of the charge. 
- Density of the lines at any point are proportional to the strength of the field at that point
- Far away from a system, the lines should look roughly like they came from a single net charge
- Field lines do not cross.
