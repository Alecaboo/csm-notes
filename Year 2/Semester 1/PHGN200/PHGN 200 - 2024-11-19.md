### phymsics
- In a lot of cases, treating light as a ray (read: doing optics) works just fine
- However, it is a wave, and as such we have to deal with some bullshit.
- If light was a ray, then we'd just add sources together and call it good
	- However, it's not! So we end up with either 4x as bright or jack didley squat if we shine two similar sources at the same point. 

### interference
- If you have two waves in phase, ie if we just had two $\sin(x)$ kinda looking waves, adding them together would give you a wave with the same phase, just double the amplitude
- If they're *out* of phase, we get destructive interference, where if you were to add, say $\sin(x)$ and $\cos(x)$ together, the net would be a fat ol' 0.

#### Cool interference applications
- Light in a material is going to be $$\lambda_{n}=\frac{\lambda_{v}}{n}$$
- Where $\lambda_{v}$ is the wavelength in a vacuum
#### Path Length Differences
- If there's a path length difference of $n\lambda$, where $n$ is some integer, we get constructive interference in the spots where it lines up and jack squat elsewhere.
	- Similar for destructive, just if we have a path length difference of $n + \frac{1}{2}$ 
- You get them when it's the same except some leftover, which is $\frac{\Delta L}{\lambda}=m$, and destructive is $\frac{\Delta L}{\lambda}=(m+ \frac{1}{2})$
- Also of note is the phase angle thing
	- The difference of  two waves with the same phase, just offset is $\delta$, where one wavelength is $2\pi$ radians of phase. For constructive interference, $\delta=2\pi m$, and destructive is $\delta = 2\pi\left(m + \frac{1}{2}\right)$ 

### Clicker time
- Two radiation sources, some distance $D$ above and below the axis. Our observation point is $L$ away, along said axis - what's the difference in path lengths?
$$\sqrt{D^{2}+L^{2}}- \sqrt{D^{2}+L^{2}}=0$$
## Thin Film Interference
- When light waves reflect off thin films of materials (oil, water, soap, etc) their waves will produce interference
- Refraction never causes a phase change, but reflection can, based on $n$ shenanigans of the materials.
- When we hit something with a higher index of refraction, the reflected wave has a phase shift of $\pi$ relative to the incident wave, ($\pi$ phase shift is like sine to cosine)
	- When bouncing off something with a low index of refraction, there is no phase shift.
	- So the interesting stuff ONLY HAPPENS with low to high.
