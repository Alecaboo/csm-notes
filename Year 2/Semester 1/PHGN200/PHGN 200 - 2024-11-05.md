## Displacement Currents
- When we have two charged plates, ie, like a capacitor, you end up with some fascinating shenanigans


$$\oint\vec{B} \cdot d\vec{\ell} = \mu_{0}I_{\text{thru} }$$
![[deeply strange electromagnetic shenanigans]]


$$\oint\vec{B}\cdot d\vec{\ell} = \mu_{0}(I_{thru}+I_{disp})= \mu_{0}I_{thru}= \mu_{0}\epsilon_{0}\frac{d\Phi_{E}}{dt}$$
- Displacement current is in the direction of the changing electric flux, ie $\Delta \Phi_{E}$


#### brief aside
- Maxwell was deeply wrong about a great deal of things, including when he thought the ether was a thing that existed and was the electromagnetic equivalent of air. Ie, like how sound waves move through air, surely EM must move through an equivalent


- A parallel plate capacitor with circular plates of radius R and a separation distance $d$ is being charged at a rate of 2 $C/s$. What is the magnitude of the displacement current through a loop with radius $a$ where $a> R$? 

- Example problem with some loop that I should embed a picture of later. #toDo type beat.


- Rate of change of charge over time, $\frac{dq}{dt}$ is 2 C/S

- At what radius is the electric field non-zero?
	- Only between the plates, so $r< R$

- Uh, finding $\Phi_{E}$
$$\Phi_{E}= \int\vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A}= EA$$
$$E_{\infty \text{ sheet}}= \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_{0}}= \frac{q}{\pi R^{2}}(2\epsilon_{0})$$
$$E_{2 \ \infty \text{ sheets}}= \frac{q}{\epsilon_{0}\pi R^{2}}$$
$$EA= \frac{q}{\epsilon_{0}\pi R^{2}}* \pi R^{2}= {\frac{q}{\epsilon_{0}}}$$

- Now finding how flux changes with time
$$I_{disp}= \epsilon_{0}\frac{d\Phi_{E}}{dt}=\frac{dq}{dt}= 2$$

## moving on, light as an electromagnetic wave or something

- Uh, these equations make sense. Mhm.

$$\frac{d^{2}E_{x}}{dx^{2}}=\epsilon_{0}\mu_{0}\frac{d^{2}E_{x}}{dt^{2}}$$
$$\frac{d^{2}B_{x}}{dx^{2}}=\epsilon_{0}\mu_{0}\frac{d^{2}B_{x}}{dt^{2}}$$
- There's some wave bullshit going on here.

$$y=y_{0}\sin(kx\mp\omega t)$$
- Holy shit, minus-plus ($\mp$) is a real symbol. I didn't expect that to work
	- $y_{0}=$ max amplitude
	- $k=$ wavelengths per unit distance
		- $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$
			- Lambda here is the distance from peak to peak - one full unit of wavelength
	- $\omega=$ angular frequency (rad/s)
- Standing wave, ie one hooked to a wall, not moving in space, etc, you don't have to worry about the $\mp$
	- If you're moving in space though, it's going to be $-\omega t$ if it's moving in the positive direction, and $+\omega t$ if it's moving in the negative direction, hence the $\mp$ 

$$E = E_{max}\sin(ky-\omega t + \Delta)$$
	- Wave number $k=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$
	- Angular frequency: $\omega=2\pi f$
	- Phase constant $\Delta$ is just shifting where it "starts"
- What do you to make it magnetic? You just change the name! $$B = B_{max}\sin(ky - \omega t + \Delta)$$
- A charged particle makes an electric field
- A moving charged particle makes a magnetic field
- An *accelerating* charged particle makes an electromagnetic wave


### energy stored in fields

$$u{E}= \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{0}E^{2}= \text{Energy density of electric field}$$
$$u_{B}= \frac{1}{2\mu_{0}}B^{2}= \text{Energy density of magnetic field}$$
Total energy of an EM wave is $u=u_E +u_{B}=\epsilon_{0}E^{2}$

$$c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_{0}\mu_{0}}}$$
- useful little cutesy discovery/derivation thing


#### example
- Magnetic field is given by $B= B_{0}\sin(\alpha\pi x - \alpha \pi \beta t)$
- Do the RMS
	- Square: $B^{2}= B_{0}^{2}\sin^{2}(\alpha \pi x - \alpha \pi \beta t)$
	- Mean: $B_{av}^{2}= B_{0}^{2} \frac{1}{2}$
	- Root: $B_{av}= \frac{B_{0}}{\sqrt{2}}$
- So $u_{B_{av}}= \frac{B_{0}^{2}}{4\mu_{0}}$
