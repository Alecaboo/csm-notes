1. Moral Relativism
	1. Is, quite descriptively, the idea that all moral positions are relative. I think you can pretty easily extrapolate this to our discussion on humans vs animals - from the relative point of view of an animal, most of what they do is moral.
3. Utilitarianism
	1. The classic "most good for the most people," standard Utilitarianism dictates that if confronted with the trolley problem - kill five, or pull the switch and kill two - you're killing two people every single time.

5. Deontology
	1. This is a set of ethics popularized by Kant talking about how actions are inherently kind of right or wrong - under deontology, lying is always wrong, even if it's "for a good cause"
		1. The idea that actions are always wrong or always right just kind of seems idealist to me? Deontology probably says that breaking the law and sitting in on a segregated area is wrong, even if you're a member of the civil rights movement exercising civil disobedience. 

7. Virtue Ethics
	1. The Aristotle classic - you should try and live a "morally good" life, trying not to be too excessive or deficient, instead just being virtuous.
		1. Definitely the outlier in that it doesn't really have guidance for individual decisions, as deontology and utilitarianism do - more of a general guidance on living life, which you have to figure out how that applies to individual decisions. 

9. Liberalism
	1. Definitely not the current American definition - liberalism is a focus on personal freedoms, and Rawls' theory on a liberal and just society is that freedom should be provided to all, not just the majority.

Money!

In a properly moral society, money should serve a purpose - to buy material goods. It shouldn't serve to purchase liberties or freedoms, in more service of a market economy than a market society. In a market society, capitalism essentially runs the show, whereas a market economy is more restrained, exclusively dealing with goods and services as opposed to society as a whole.

Kidney Discussion
- Essentially, the various objections centered around people's state in society - they might be essentially forced into organ sale, or be unable to afford an organ due to the vices of capitalism - essentially, one student compares it to the American healthcare system. 

- I think running up the classic theories this is definitely a negative under utilitarianism - if you extrapolate the objections into what would actually happen, it seems fairly obvious that there would not be a whole lot of good happening for a whole lot of people.
