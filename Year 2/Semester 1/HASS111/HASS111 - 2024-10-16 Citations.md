Just as a general note: I was trying to get some more different perspectives and such during this round of citations, because I feel like I fairly effectively mined the energy bit over the last bundle of citations.


J. Kreitler, C. A. Schloss, O. Soong, L. Hannah, and F. W. Davis, “Conservation Planning for Offsetting the Impacts of Development: A Case Study of Biodiversity and Renewable Energy in the Mojave Desert,” _PloS one_, vol. 10, no. 11, pp. e0140226–e0140226, 2015, doi: [10.1371/journal.pone.0140226](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0140226).
- This source is talking about some of the impacts of large scale solar installations - pretty much exclusively what I'm interested in - on biodiversity in the Mojave Desert, which, again, is effectively what I'm interested in. This is getting in to one of the different perspectives of stakeholders with regards to the desert - biodiversity and preservation of local flora and fauna is a rather important angle, but one not at all covered by standard considerations of monetary cost or energy density.
