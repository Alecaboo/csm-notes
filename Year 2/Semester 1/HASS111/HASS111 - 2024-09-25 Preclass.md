1. Message/Purpose
	1. There's an argument that Katz has several theses being argued, but I would say his main thesis is that engineering/technology cannot be independent of virtues. He goes into examples of supposedly neutral technological examples, and how they were, in fact, not that.
2. Author
	1. Katz situates himself as someone responsible for teaching engineers - so many times throughout the text, they reinforce their point of view as someone who's teaching engineers and setting younger engineer's expectations. 
3. Audience
	1. Similar to his position as an author, many of Katz's arguments are founded around the idea that he is teaching young engineers the nature of their profession - I don't want to find a direct statement, but like, it comes up a lot.
4. Genre and Audience
	1. Nope. I think, if anything, it reinforces his point - the people most likely to be assigned (or just generally likely to read academic texts) are either students or fellow academics, so publishing his work in a scholarly book perfectly reinforces the audience.
5. Mode
	1. Katz does an excellent job of synthesizing works that he doesn't necessarily agree with - for instance, Katz synthesizes Speer's memoirs into his thesis, but he doesn't just restate Speer's perspective, or any kind of copying - he derives his argument usign it as evidence. 
6. Structure
	1. Katz follows a fairly straightforward argument structure here of laying out his point, knocking in a few examples, smacking at the counterargument a bit, then wrapping back out with examples and a recap. It's a tried and true argument structure, and katz applies it well to make his point.
7. Evidence
	1. I touched on this a bit in mode, but Speer's memoirs are excellently introduced - they're presented as the flawed source they are, and used as an excellent insight into Nazi psyche, but not treated as objective fact, because they're not - they're the memoirs of a damned fascist trying to scrape themselves out of a very very dark hole. Part of me now wants to read Speer's memoirs to better understand the degree to which Katz synthesized instead of just ripping straight from, because despite the ethos he goes into, I still am morbidly curious about Speer's exact writing.
8. Attribution
	1. I am not going to go back through and backdate all these in the awful etext, I can do this live if this comes up. Sorry prof!
