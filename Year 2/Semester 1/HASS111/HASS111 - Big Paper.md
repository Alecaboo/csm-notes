## Abstract

The Mojave Desert is a lot of space with a large number of interested parties - from flora, fauna, residents, and even energy interests, a great deal of people want their own pound of flesh. Solar interests are of particular relevancy because land utilized for solar can't really be used for too much else - shockingly, it's quite difficult for plants to grow when all of the light is being used for power generation. There are a great deal of ethical dilemmas when considering an ecosystem the size of the Mojave, and attempting to resolve some of them is the goal of this paper. To what degree should preservation of biodiversity be prioritized as opposed to potential expansion of industry? Does solar even make the most sense when trying to generate energy, or is there a more efficient use of land? <sub>I don't have a good way to get out of this paragraph, but I need to move on from this paragraph</sub>

Luckily, this is a topic of significant research interest to a great deal of parties - for instance, a number of researchers from Boise State and UC Santa Barbara put together a software solution to attempt to analyze "Desert Renewable Energy" in the Mojave \[1]. A particularly interesting aspect of this study is that it was published in 2015 examining the theoretical impacts upon biodiversity in a fairly wide range of over fifteen thousand hectares, land which has since partially been developed for wide scale solar interests. While the researchers conclusion was that there was a manageable but somewhat concerning impact upon biodiversity, it's nonetheless fascinating to see the decisions made by industry vs what researchers said should happen.

One of the most significant impacts from large scale solar implementations is the degree of land covered, which proceeds to cause a significant amount of knock on effects as an environment used to receiving regular full sunlight is no longer getting such sun. \[6] This ends up in a net increase in the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> produced from land, even if solar doesn't produce a relevant quantity of carbon dioxide - this is due to changes caused in the soil, in the water, as well as flora and fauna. \[5]  One example of an impact on fauna is the amount of birds and bats found dead at both photovoltaic and thermal solar - over 250,000 birds and 10,000 bats were estimated killed at solar installations in the Mojave, with a noticeable amount more found upon closer inspection. \[9]

An equally relevant aspect of the utilization of land in the desert is the opinion of both lawmakers and local residents. Generally, local residents are in favor of solar developments because they aren't using the land generally being developed for solar for anything, because the most convenient areas for solar are non-developed, flat areas without anything significant other than power poles around.  \[7] Lawmakers are additionally in favor of attempting to develop land throughout California for general resource production, which was originally written into law as an attempt to develop land for agriculture, but large swathes of the Mojave desert aren't viable for agriculture in any way shape or form. This is largely due to a lack of water or general resource availability, but "spending" the land on solar isn't nearly as much of a strain on infrastructure, so California lawmakers are willing to subsidize land that was agriculturally allocated to be instead used for solar interests. \[6].

Overall, there are a great deal of conflicting interests, the most significant through line between them being the impact upon the local environment. Dead birds don't particularly care about who holds the land rights for the area, but both lawmakers and dead birds are forced to contend with the environmental impact of their decisions. This extends beyond just birds and lawmakers, but attempting to use the state of the local environment as the connecting tissue between researchers, the natural world, local residents, and not so local policymakers is the most eminently reasonable possible policy decision.

- This source is talking about some of the impacts of large scale solar installations - pretty much exclusively what I'm interested in - on biodiversity in the Mojave Desert, which, again, is effectively what I'm interested in. This is getting in to one of the different perspectives of stakeholders with regards to the desert - biodiversity and preservation of local flora and fauna is a rather important angle, but one not at all covered by standard considerations of monetary cost or energy density.

- This is a wonderful source talking about exactly what I would like to examine in my paper! The team looks at the impact of building big solar in California, especially in somewhat remote areas that are disconnected from most infrastructure, which is exactly the kind of thing that inspired me to write about this as my project. The authors of this paper are/were located at various UC campuses, based in their respective energy departments.

- This source is a bit more of a second order point - one of the big sub arguments I think I'll end up pursuing in my paper is the potential other uses for the land. In order to effectively make a point regarding that, I at least feel that it would be reasonable to establish the benefits of solar land use, which this paper goes into the effective power generation per meter of various solar installations throughout California, including, again, the ones that inspired me to write this paper. Some repeat authors here in Hernandez and Hoffacker, and Field is currently a co-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a position he assumed roughly a year after this was published.

- This is a bit of an earlier source, so pushing the boundaries of what I'm willing to include in this paper, but the sheer quantity of research that went into this paper makes it worth including (in my opinion). This was a massive collaboration between not only California universities, but also several international contributions including Australia and Spain to develop a full picture report of *everything* related to implementing solar, from material acquisition to soil impact. I don't entirely know what I'll be using from this source, but the exhaustive degree of research they did makes me certain that I will at least *somehow* be bringing their work into my report.

- Wonderful scholarly source talking about the various "trickle down" impacts of land use for solar, which is exactly one of the topics that I would love to focus on for this project. Provides a good deal of straight numerical figures, and some potential avenues for additional research - like other alternative land uses.

- California Bill regarding the use of agricultural land for solar panels and easements provided for them. Definitely an interesting avenue of research, as it follows in on "alternate uses for the land" other than solar power, and an interesting legal precedent that's factored in to several other decisions / potential sources.

“Vote solar: Survey finds southern california desert communities support solar development,” _Professional Services Close-Up_, 2012.

- This source is the start of my effort to get non-academic sources - trying to figure out the degree to which actual residents and not just academic sources care about solar panel, and the resounding answer is that most residents are in fact in favor of solar. Useful for diversifying sources, my only real problem with it is that it's from 2012. Otherwise, a solidly diversified source and works out.

- Back to academic sources, but this one isn't written by Hernandez! This is getting in to some of the other ecological debates surrounding solar in the desert - there are gobs upon gobs of sources dealing with the energy impact and land use efficiency or whatever, but not as much dealing with the various flora surrounding the area.

K. S. Smallwood, “Utility‐scale solar impacts to volant wildlife,” _The Journal of wildlife management_, vol. 86, no. 4, 2022.

- On the other side of the coin, dealing with a lot of fauna in the area! Another academic source dealing with local wildlife impacts, but this one focuses less on flora and bit more on general wildlife (still including flora, but also fauna). Good for diversification of perspectives

- Alrighty, so I'm definitely not at fifteen sources - I'm doing my best to find some additional non-academic sources to round out my argument, but I feel like I have a really good base of knowledge to argue forward. I'm a little stuck in attempting to find some more non-academic sources - more trying to figure out what I could be looking for as opposed to actually finding things is what I'm really stuck on. Overall though, I think I'm in a good position to have this project done in a reasonable timeframe, just need to wrap out non-academic sources.
