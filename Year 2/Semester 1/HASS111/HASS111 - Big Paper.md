## Abstract

The Mojave Desert is a lot of space with a large number of interested parties - from flora, fauna, residents, and even energy interests, a great deal of people want their own pound of flesh. Solar interests are of particular relevancy because land utilized for solar can't really be used for too much else - shockingly, it's quite difficult for plants to grow when all of the light is being used for power generation. There are a great deal of ethical dilemmas when considering an ecosystem the size of the Mojave, and attempting to resolve some of them is the goal of this paper. To what degree should preservation of biodiversity be prioritized as opposed to potential expansion of industry? Does solar even make the most sense when trying to generate energy, or is there a more efficient use of land? 

Luckily, this is a topic of significant research interest to a great deal of parties - for instance, a number of researchers from Boise State and UC Santa Barbara put together a software solution to attempt to analyze "Desert Renewable Energy" in the Mojave \[1]. A particularly interesting aspect of this study is that it was published in 2015 examining the theoretical impacts upon biodiversity in a fairly wide range of over fifteen thousand hectares, land which has since partially been developed for wide scale solar interests. While the researchers conclusion was that there was a manageable but somewhat concerning impact upon biodiversity, it's nonetheless fascinating to see the decisions made by industry vs what researchers said should happen. Similarly, researchers throughout the University of California network did their best to estimate how efficient using land for solar was, as opposed to potential other applications or even other solar farms - a fascinating conclusion from this is that private solar is almost always more efficient than public solar, which is likely due to the scale of implementation - a private purveyor of solar is going to do their best to make the absolute most of what limited space they're working with, whereas a larger solar farm is likely going for "good enough" since there's so much more land they have to make solar work for.\[3]

Another interesting dimension of the production of solar energy is *where* you end up doing the construction - obviously we're talking about building it out in the Mojave desert, but it's an entirely different conundrum if you're building it ten minutes outside of Reno opposed to ten miles from the nearest power line. Lots of these areas that may be ten miles from the nearest power line are to some degree "protected" - either by a land conservation measure, an ordinance restricting land use, or any other range of legal restrictions.  These protected areas represent excellent potential avenues for construction, but do mandate additional resources both to fix the ten mile pole problem, as well as the other environmental impacts that developing previously protected or otherwise not used land with large solar installations. \[2] Some of these protected areas contain plants that have laid undisturbed for thousands of years, and tearing up their root structures and established networks leads to significant knock-on problems. \[11] Cacti and yucca, some of the most significant and iconic desert plants, are the most impacted by these installations, as they in no way evolved to attempt to survive with massive lakes of solar panels on top of them, leading to an ecological niche rapidly emptying and assorted other invasive plants attempting to fill the gap, degrading the state of the environment. \[8]

One of the most significant impacts from large scale solar implementations is the degree of land covered, which proceeds to cause a significant amount of knock on effects as an environment used to receiving regular full sunlight is no longer getting such sun. \[6] This ends up in a net increase in the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> produced from land, even if solar doesn't produce a relevant quantity of carbon dioxide - this is due to changes caused in the soil, in the water, as well as flora and fauna. \[4]\[5]  One example of an impact on fauna is the amount of birds and bats found dead at both photovoltaic and thermal solar - over 250,000 birds and 10,000 bats were estimated killed at solar installations in the Mojave, with a noticeable amount more found upon closer inspection. \[9] This also factors in to the "Land Ethic," popularized by Aldo Leopold, which postulates that humans need to consider the interconnectedness of the land, not only in relation to themselves but also in relation to *everything*. \[10] While it may seem like a no brainer, generating free electricity is a positive, it's not quite so black and white when you consider the various impacts on the land and the creatures and the plants, and so many more besides. 

An equally relevant aspect of the utilization of land in the desert is the opinion of both lawmakers and local residents. Generally, local residents are in favor of solar developments because they aren't using the land generally being developed for solar for anything, because the most convenient areas for solar are non-developed, flat areas without anything significant other than power poles around.  \[7] Lawmakers are additionally in favor of attempting to develop land throughout California for general resource production, which was originally written into law as an attempt to develop land for agriculture, but large swathes of the Mojave desert aren't viable for agriculture in any way shape or form. This is largely due to a lack of water or general resource availability, but "spending" the land on solar isn't nearly as much of a strain on infrastructure, so California lawmakers are willing to subsidize land that was agriculturally allocated to be instead used for solar interests. \[6]. On the other hand, residents that are negatively impacted due to extreme proximity to solar farms, like citizens at Lake Tamarisk Resort, are noticeably more opposed to building of these solar farms. \[11] When their home might suddenly be only 200 meters away from a solar installation, and they might've had to inhale months worth of construction dust, they're noticeably less in favor,. 

Despite all the upsides of solar energy and harvesting free power, there's a rather lengthy and terrible list of arguments against establishing big solar in the way that we currently are. One through line that researchers, residents, and rodents can all agree on is that the impact on the local environment is paramount to consider when attempting to establish massive scale solar operations. If California wants to continue filling the Mojave desert with oceans of solar power, then there needs to be a serious reconsideration regarding the consequences of its construction. Building more solar isn't a bad thing, but with the current state of affairs, academic research shows a significant amount of problems, local residents have a significant amount of complaints, and the environment is showing significant negative effects such that change *is* needed.

- This source is talking about some of the impacts of large scale solar installations - pretty much exclusively what I'm interested in - on biodiversity in the Mojave Desert, which, again, is effectively what I'm interested in. All of the researchers on this project are established in their field, working out of either Boise's USGS office or the University of Santa Barbara, which factors in to some of them appearing again later in other sources. This is getting in to one of the different perspectives of stakeholders with regards to the desert - biodiversity and preservation of local flora and fauna is a rather important angle, but one not at all covered by standard considerations of monetary cost or energy density.

- This is a wonderful source talking about exactly what I would like to examine in my paper! The team looks at the impact of building big solar in California, especially in somewhat remote areas that are disconnected from most infrastructure, which is exactly the kind of thing that inspired me to write about this as my project. The authors of this paper are/were located at various UC campuses, based in their respective energy departments, with the frontrunner, Rebecca Hernandez, being a major coordinator of ecological aspects of energy systems at UC Davis.

- This source is a bit more of a second order point - one of the big sub arguments I think I'll end up pursuing in my paper is the potential other uses for the land. In order to effectively make a point regarding that, I at least feel that it would be reasonable to establish the benefits of solar land use, which this paper goes into the effective power generation per meter of various solar installations throughout California, including, again, the ones that inspired me to write this paper. Some repeat authors here in Hernandez and Hoffacker, and Field is currently a co-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a position he assumed roughly a year after this was published.

- This is a bit of an earlier source, so pushing the boundaries of what I'm willing to include in this paper, but the sheer quantity of research that went into this paper makes it worth including (in my opinion). This was a massive collaboration between not only California universities, but also several international contributions including Australia and Spain to develop a full picture report of *everything* related to implementing solar, from material acquisition to soil impact. I don't entirely know what I'll be using from this source, but the exhaustive degree of research they did makes me certain that I will at least *somehow* be bringing their work into my report.

- Wonderful scholarly source lead by Dirk-Jan van de Ven, a postdoctoral researcher based in Spain talking about the various "trickle down" impacts of land use for solar, which is exactly one of the topics that I would love to focus on for this project. Provides a good deal of straight numerical figures, and some potential avenues for additional research - like other alternative land uses.

- California Bill regarding the use of agricultural land for solar panels and easements provided for them. Definitely an interesting avenue of research, as it follows in on "alternate uses for the land" other than solar power, and an interesting legal precedent that's factored in to several other decisions / potential sources.

- This source is the start of my effort to get non-academic sources - trying to figure out the degree to which actual residents and not just academic sources care about solar panel, and the resounding answer is that most residents are in fact in favor of solar. Useful for diversifying sources given that it's a survey conducted by a company now owned by Dow Jones LLC. My only real problem with it is that it's from 2012, and therefore a good bit outdated, but useful as a source of perspective nontheless.

- Back to academic sources, but this one isn't written by Hernandez, although still published through the UC system. This is getting in to some of the other ecological debates surrounding solar in the desert - there's an incredible amount of academic research surrounding the actual power generation, and even animal impact, but the impact upon desert cacti and assorted other flora is noticeably less considered, even if it's just as if not more impactful.

- This is an academic source published by a single independent researcher, Shawn Smallwood, who dot his doctorate in Ecology and has been publishing research papers regarding fauna and, well, ecology for the last thirty years. This particular source looks at the impact of solar on wildlife in the area, with particularly gruesome figures regarding the number of animals killed either through construction or operation of various sites,.

- I wanted to make an effort to tie some of the course readings into my paper, and I feel this is the most applicable. I'm essentially dealing with an environmental problem, so attempting to view the issue from the point of view of "how does the rest of the environment" factor was a fairly solid metric to attempt to diversify my perspectives. Justification aside, this is Aldo Leopold's original argument regarding humans viewing the interconnectedness of land, which sorts out quite nicely for this paper.

- Again continuing my effort to include less scholarly sources, this is examining more of the opinions of local residents as opposed to academic survey. The Guardian is a fairly reliable newspaper and they cited their sources consistently, although their whole being based in Britain is an interesting factor. A major concern brought up in this particular article that none of my other sources really mentioned was the construction itself - obviously the structure, once it's done, will have a significant impact, but what gets dug up in the process - that being a remarkably large quantity of dust - is equally as problematic as the end result.
