### recounting what we were doing
- "Is it Wrong" was principles and reasons
- "Seeing Nature" was talking about different ways of seeing
- "Moral Machines" was also principles

- Deontologist nerds care about actions, Utilitarianism is outcome focused, virtue ethics cares about the person doing it

- 

## Discussion

#### Overview
- Jot down an example, confusion, question, I'm wondering, I'm curious, etc
	- Advocate
	- Accept
	- Question
	- Deny
	- Spectrum of opinion from Yeah! to No way!
#### Moral Relativism
- Does this have to be mutually exclusive with the other theories? I feel like you can make the argument for utilitarianism from a morally relativistic perspective 
	- If I were to codify this in the main structure, I would say that I advocate for Moral Relativism because all things are relative
#### Utilitarianism 
- I... accept utilitarianism, because I feel like in general it's a fairly good framework, but taken to the extreme you can rapidly get into doing calculus with people's lives, which again can get really messy really quickly.

#### Deontology
- I deny deontology, because I feel there's a lot of actions that can probably be considered morally wrong that are not morally wrong in a larger, more outcome / ideal based framework.
