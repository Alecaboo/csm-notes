| **NATURE 8/28**                                                  | [Nature in Golden](https://new.express.adobe.com/webpage/j6osA1pVXh0m9?)                    | Particularly remember going and going on an adventure out and about as a group for this one - we had a good conversation about how humans are/are not a part of nature, and our argument landed on that humans make arguments to justify things, whereas animals really just do them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **MORAL SPHERES 8/28**                                           | [Moral spheres](https://express.adobe.com/page/ZTeGAB9Bsr3Q4/)                              | My group disagreed with the moral sphere setup we were provided, because it placed pretty much all family members on the innermost circle, closer than any kind of friend, which we definitely felt was wrong. I remember us making this argument, and the rest of the class more or less agreeing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **INTRO TO ETHICS 9/4 & 9/11**                                   | [Intro to Moral Philosophy](https://express.adobe.com/page/vLeebwbNrDHbP/)                  | This was the class where we got in a bunch of class-wide arguments about different moral philosophies, and essentially the way that shook out was that every philosophy is problematic when you take it to the extreme. I, for one, had been an advocate for moral relativism, because I generally feel that most decisions are in fact relative (not absolute, no Good Place points shenanigans), but that obviously becomes problematic when you take certain things to the extremes.                                                  |
| **PROF. ETHICS 9/25 & 10/2**                                     | [Science & Engineering Ethics](https://express.adobe.com/page/vVCczNT5qWe1G/)               | This is the class that I distinctly remember the reading - Katz's Nazi Engineers work - and largely discussing it as our main point of order throughout class. Distinct takeaways from this was a lot of talk about being unable to engineer in a vacuum, but being able to engineer in a scope that doesn't leave you... culpable for your actions, in a sense? Someone building mass cremation ovens for the camps knows what they're doing, but someone who just makes fire resistant bricks may not know the scope of their actions. |
| **ENVIRO ETHICS 10/9 & 10/16**                                   | [Environmental Ethics](https://express.adobe.com/page/qglgkofpJqLA6/)                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **ETHICS OF JUSTICE**                                            | [What is Justice?](https://express.adobe.com/page/AQFrnsNyhBfAo/)                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **DIGITAL TECH & ETHICS 10/30 & 11/6**                           | **(optional)**  [Digi Tech lecture activity](https://express.adobe.com/page/bYRSW08llEVui/) | Big big class talk, my foremost memory of which was discussion of privacy and the degree of interconnectedness between people, and how far is too far. Is being able to constantly reach people for work or school a bad thing (short answer: yeah); to what degree should online forums and such be moderated?                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **ENVIRON- MENTAL JUSTICE CASES 11/13, 11/20, research project** | [Environmental Justice](https://express.adobe.com/page/kbWUaoGqDSowG/)                      | Liiiiitle bit of Hack the Story talk, but not really a big focus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
