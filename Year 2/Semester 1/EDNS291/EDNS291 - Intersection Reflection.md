#edns291 #design 


Honestly, one of the *easiest* parts of the project was breaking the intersection down into parts that we understood. Me and Jacksyn brainstormed by thinking of things we could deconstruct, as opposed to picking an intersection and then thinking about deconstructing it. This made it really easy to get a broad overview of the project - we knew what was *broadly* happening - we had been involved, after all, but thinking through some of the finer nuances was definitely a bit more complicated because we had been that personally involved and then had to back out and think about it from a wider perspective. To that extent, I feel like we did a really good job of considering the different end users... that we put effort into considering. We thought about our own jobs (RA, Peer Mentor) and the main end user (First years), but didn't really put specific thought or planning into staff or faculty. As an extension of that, the degree to which all of these different groups are intertwined, where even though we focused on the experience for three of them, we almost certainly improved the experience of staff and faculty by extension is kind of neat. 

I feel like the "worst" part of our intersection is how it feels like it was designed for a very specific user that is not all or even most of the students involved in Helluva Welcome. In theory, Helluva Welcome is a fun, activity filled week, with lots of variety to keep people engaged and entertained throughout - the reality isn't necessarily that experience for many new Orediggers. For some, it is! And that's wonderful, and an example of how Helluva Welcome was clearly designed - but for many others who don't get that intended experience, many of the positives become negatives. Trying to drag more people out of the negative and into the positive was a big goal of us redesigning the week, and I feel as if we succeeded to a respectable degree. 

Our design process involved a large quantity of brainstorming, quite a lot of prototyping, and then essentially producing our final product. We spent a good amount of time trying to figure out what we were doing at all, how our redesign would work, what could we think about changing - all of which I would classify under brainstorming, for this context. We then moved to "prototyping," where we sketched out a schedule and tried out different options until we both agreed that it was a reasonable compromise, and after several repeat iterations of that, we split and worked on our respective portions of the final product. If we were to do this again, though, I would definitely try and get even more feedback, and ideally from broader groups - we mostly got responses for our survey from Jacksyn's residents, and even then we did most of our prototyping before we had those responses. So, I've ended up saying "being a little bit less rushed," which is always the case, but yeah, getting the chance to actually process some data before needing to brainstorm without being behind would be kinda nice. 

Honestly, I feel like our redesign is entirely possible to work as proposed. Obviously it would need a whole lot more administrative looking over and logistical considering than just what me and Jacksyn are aware of, but overall I don't feel like anything is too terribly outrageous that it's impossible. 

Working with a partner (the wonderful Jacksyn) on this project was great because 1. there's absolutely no way I would've managed to get thirty responses to a survey on my own in the time she did 2. we were able to fairly evenly split the labor in order to actually get things done. With more than two people on a team, especially when people don't necessarily have specialties, it can get really annoying really quickly to split work up. With two people though, it was really easy to state what we were both good at, to determine how we were splitting work up, and overall have a good time with the project. 

I feel like my overall takeaways from this project were like those from a really good warmup - I feel refreshed on some design thinking practices, like considering user experience and not just necessarily whether or not something "works." I learned that sometimes it can be really nice to make something someone else's job- especially if that someone would rather do that job than what you're doing! I do feel that I could do better to actually apply data to drive our decisions, instead of just reinforcing them - as part of our structure, we ended up using data to reinforce the prototypes and ideas we already had, instead of using the data to make decisions about what prototypes we should be making. This project was also an adventure in the eternal quest to make a good presentation for your audience, to which I always find the first presentation the worst - you don't necessarily know the crowd that well, so it can be a bit rough finding the right amount of humor and what have you to put in. I feel like the best way to apply these - and the countless other lessons I haven't listed - to my final project is to not get lost in the complexity of whatever I end up working on. Objectively, this was a fairly simple project - I mean, we managed to slap a deliverable together in about a week without any prior planning. Remembering how successful we were, even with so little time, is a great takeway.


P.S. to Dr. Sheppard - Sorry that I turned this in late. As an apology, I provide this image of what was keeping me busy over the weekend: ![[99585306-0456-413C-9242-F7C7609A5039.jpg]]
