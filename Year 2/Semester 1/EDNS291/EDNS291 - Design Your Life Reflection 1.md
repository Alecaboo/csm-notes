I discovered that the reason I do work, a lot of the time, is because I enjoy making things happen for other people. Which sounds kind of simple and clich√©, but I discovered this through doing backstage theater tech for youth theater - which, in full transparency, I started doing because I was getting really tired of watching my sister perform in the same youth theater shows year over year. So I started working backstage, and I walked away from a six hour shift backstage smiling and looking forward to going back the next day, because the result of my work was for the actors - most of whom were between the ages of six and eight, and by extension absolutely adorable - to not have thought about my work, and just been doing their thing, and being happy with it. An additional component to that was knowing that *I* am good at doing what I'm doing, which is a bit shallow, but having confidence in yourself isn't exactly a bad thing. If I'm able to do work that I know I'm good at in order to make someone else's life better/happier, then I'm satisfied. 

There's the follow up of "What about money?," which is part of why I'm in DE as a program - I believe it provides an opportunity for me to do more user focused work, while still being an engineer and compensated appropriately for that. I think it's entirely possible for me to find a job where I get to make user's lives happier or better in some way, by applying my own unique skills, and get compensated in a reasonable manner for that.

My main view on the "Purpose of Life" is that everyone should strive to be happy, in whatever that means for them. For me, that means having friends that I make smile - I *delight* in making terrible jokes and references that only I might hear, but when somebody else does, I've not only successfully made someone smile, I've made a connection with. I think that kind of addresses most of the talking points - I value at least some kind of connection between myself and others, and spreading joy is definitely at the forefront of how I attempt to go through life. 

I think my views on work and life absolutely complement each other - I enjoy doing work that enhances someone else's life experience, which fits neatly in to my view on life. They absolutely feed into and drive the other, and I don't feel like it's a terribly conflicting kind of set of views - believing that everyone should be happy, and enjoying doing work that makes other people happy is a very nice loop that I've stumbled into and hope I manage to keep doing in/beyond college.
