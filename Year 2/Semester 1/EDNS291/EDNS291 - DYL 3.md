## ANALYZE
1. Activities
	1. All of my most engaged with activities were group work, which is similarly when I entered a state of flow most often. Generally I was more engaged in group work that I'm confident in doing - which feels fairly straightforward, but I guess makes sense that I feel more engaged when I'm just working, as opposed to learning how to work.
2. Environments
	1. All over the place, honestly. Chauvenet (where tech theater takes place) is super cramped and filled with mild health hazards, and I was arguably more engaged there than I was in the much less cramped Labriola wood shop for my 291 group work time, so, no specific factors I'm noticing there.
3. Interactions
	1. Lots of interactions with familiar-ish things in highly engaged activities - tools I basically know how to use, math I know the process of, etc. Lots of these were a slight bit of learning (ie, the Labriola woodshop in particular), but overall familiar processes, which likely contributed to me being able to enter a state of flow. 
4. Objects
	1. Equipment I was familiar with is the common thread here - I know how to use a whiteboard (for my calc worksheet), I know what I'm doing in a woodshop - so yeah, general tools I was familiar with.
5. Users
	1. This is the grab bag, actually - most of my most engaged times were with people that I was already familiar with or had worked with in some capacity, but one of my big energy positive activities was Discover Mines, and I similarly was basically meeting my Automata team during these long work days (as I hadn't worked with either of them before, or even really talked much up to this point). That said, it was interacting with people that made my positive experiences positive - the energy sucking ones (like my solo calculus homework) were alone and both unengaging and de-energizing, so interaction is definitely a key. 
## THEMES/PATTERNS/TRENDS
- I kind of went into this throughout all of my individual points, but the big kind of overview I got from filling out each individual category is when I'm working with people in a space that I'm comfortable (but not necessarily an expert in) is key to me being engaged and in flow. The not necessarily an expert part, I think is key - when I'm learning something through working with other people doing something that I *mostly* (but not fully) understand/are comfortable with, I'm super engaged and walk away energized knowing that I learned something. 

- Working alone on low stakes things didn't leave me particularly engaged or energized, but working towards a shared goal (like I was during some time in tech theater) or in a high stakes environment (like my quiz) was really good for my engagement, so I guess the takeaway there is to find something that I'm actually motivated to do (reductive, but true).
