_**The Experience**_

1. This project went really really well, honestly. We pretty much followed our initial plans for how we would go about creating our systems - we had some minor growing pains, but overall it went really well. I mostly worked on the initial plan for the electrical system, followed by doing the entirety of the coding, which I'm frankly rather proud of.

**_Your Technology Stretch_**

1. We first started with saying what we wanted our project to do - from there, we set about determining how we wanted to it do that, and then we set about actually making the board *work*. This was a bit of an interesting one because there were a lot of different parts, but fundamentally only one person could really be working on any given part at a time, so we set up some very distinct division of labor in order to make the project actually remotely possible in our timeframe.

_**The Big Question**_

- My biggest takeaway from this project has to be the incredible value of being able to actually test your product - I did hours upon hours of coding work, setting up a scaffold of everything I wanted to do, finding errors that came up when I even tried to compile the code - for it to not work at all when I actually plugged it in and started testing it. I then promptly started doing an entirely different set of error finding and debugging and so on and so forth, and ended up rewriting most of the chess pieces due to problems that I just could not identity for whatever reason. I also learned a fair bit about C++ and Arduino specifically - while I did have past experience, this was the most integrated project I've worked on - my past experience is in a "glitter bomb" style device, which only took one input and had a few pre-determined outputs, and a rotary encoder, which only took one input and purely put it out to code. This project had nine inputs and outputs that all had to be managed through code, which was such a fun thing to do. 

_**And finally,**_

- Applying this to the final project is an interesting question because we're planning on making a full extension of this project - with more refined code, chassis, scaled up, so really *everything* is applied to the final. I think the big general takeaway is having teammates that you trust to get stuff done so that you can effectively delegate work was both my favorite part of this project and my biggest takeaway - knowing that Will or Zach had something and I could trust them to get it done was really, really great.
