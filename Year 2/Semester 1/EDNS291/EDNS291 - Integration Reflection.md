_**The Experience**_


Hardest part of this experience was far and away time management - we knew it would be difficult going in, and, shockingly, it was still quite hard. I'm most proud of how everything work - our problem was a bit of a kicker because it was both technically difficult *and* and a massive pain in the neck in terms of scale. I'm especially proud of the code, which I was again just responsible for and ended up working out well. I feel like some of the other projects did a good job of *not* hitting both ways of being a pain in the neck, so definitely a consideration for future projects of making sure things aren't technically complicated and a major scale. 

**_Your Integrated Skills Project_**


We did a lot of sketching and experimentation throughout this process - for me with the software, how I ended up making was I brainstormed all of the improvements I wanted to make to my process, and then I grabbed a fourth-year comp sci and ran over a lot of the specific details of my process to see if my plan was a reasonable way of implementing, which it was! I got some specific feedbacks on the finer point of memory implementation, especially when I smacked against the memory limits on the Arduino, so having a more experienced coder as reference was great. 

Honestly, I don't even know if there would be any significant changes I would make to our process. The only really big change I would make is pivoting away from the lights earlier - if I had completely given up on the lights before I spent 20+ hours attempting to solder things together, we could've had a fully functional system, just without the light output. Pivoting the Sunday before the presentation was due, with a functional input system Tuesday morning, meant that the code was on a bit of a time crunch, so the fact that that worked out quite as well as it did is frankly astounding. 

More money more time would be to... make it work. This project objectively could've worked just with more time, but also outsourcing the mass amount of soldering would've been great. Most of the wire snipping feels like it could've been done really efficiently by some kind of automated machine, given that it was an incredibly large amount of cutting the same length of wire and so on and so forth.

_**The Big Question**_


The greatest takeaway I had from this project was the difficulty of scale and manufacturing, especially with limited resources. I feel like we did a good job with the technical skills we used, we did a good job with our presentations, we did a good job documenting, a good job planning - but it really was a difficulty with scale of manufacturing. A lot of projects I've worked on previously up to this point were either small in scale, high in complexity, high in scale but small in complexity, and the only project I've truly worked on that was high in scale and in complexity was on a twenty+ person team, so it was actually possible to delegate work more than in just a three person manufacturing crew. Other than that, I feel like I did an excellent job solidifying and using the rest of the skills throughout the design process, it was really just the scale.

The other kicker was knowing when to pivot - we probably should've jumped ship on the lights a week before we did, which again would've lead to a completely different result at the end because of a lack of wasted time. Oh well, you live and learn. 

_**And Everyone's Favorite Question**_

I feel like I kind of hit all my big points - really just a project that was this close to working, and it was just a manner of not pivoting early enough / not having enough time, which was especially funny given that we knew this is what we would be working on from the start. You live and learn, I suppose.
