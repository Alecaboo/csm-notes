### intersection observation (roundabout)
- this inter sure is section!
- noticeably more traffic congestion from the east side
- pedestrian options aren't exactly great, espescially to get all the way from main campus (in the northeast "corner") to the band building / parking lot (in the southwest corner)
	- This might be partially contributing to that whole eastbound problem
	- Also there's no footpath at all to get from the southwest corner straight across (towards greek housing), which isn't like, massive, but is still something of an interest
- Big island in the middle is theoretically safe for pedestrians, but large vehicles (like a concrete truck) end up going super close to it (and there are pretty clearly tire marks on the median, because people whip turns all the way around)
- No signals for pedestrians, so you purely have to rely on people who may be whipping a turn all the way around the roundabout to be looking
