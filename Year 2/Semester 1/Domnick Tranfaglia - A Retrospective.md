As established members of the Mines campus community, I'm sure many of you have received emails from Captain Dominick Tranfaglia, the Officer Selection Officer of the United States Marine Corps.  I, personally, aim to unsubscribe from as many mailing lists as possible, and I took no action to sign up for Tranfaglia's email list, nor was there any convenient method to unsubscribe from his emails. So, being a bored college student, I decided to take matters a bit more... personally.

I addressed an email on September 10, 2024 to our friend the Captain, detailing my general feelings regarding his continued communication, pictured below.![[Screenshot 2024-10-01 at 7.54.09 PM.png]]

I received no sign of a reply, nor did I see any continued communication. Nevertheless, a week later, I start hearing word that dearest Dominick was setting out letters again. At first, I thought I was safe - I was seeing YikYak posts that a fresh email from Captain Slurs had been out, and I had not a whiff of his name in my inbox.

That is, until about 5:00 that night, when, lo and behold, I receive an email detailing leadership training in Quantico, Virgina. My frustration, my rage, was immense - I thought I was safe, in the clear - I thought that never again would I have to read a pandering email from the Marines detailing how awesome they were. I was wrong.

I took my time to formulate a proper response, and tonight, October 1st, 2024, I began writing another email detailing the depths of my frustration to Dommy boy. An important note, throughout this process, is that I aspired to remain eminently professional in my communication. I may be stooping to levels of deep sarcasm, and mild social faux pas by including "fuck off" as a consistent message in my writing, but I would not attack the Captain's person nor organization.

I wrote this.

Arguably, I strayed from my goal of remaining professional - my concluding line regarding getting lost may have been perceived as a character slight, but, overall, I remained somewhat polite. I wished the esteemed Cap'n good luck in recruiting so long as it did not pertain to me, and, of course, signed off my email with a polite callback to my earlier work.

Dominick was clearly both not pleased and has push notifications on, because at 7:19, nine minutes after I sent my email, I received a reply. ![[Screenshot 2024-10-01 at 8.01.46 PM.png]]
In his reply, Dominick has violated the rules of engagement - he attacked my character. I feel that disparaging my ability to *communicate effectively* is not only a low blow, but is fundamentally incorrect - the point of communication is to *communicate* how I feel. I challenge anyone with a reading comprehension above that of a particularly intelligent silverback gorilla to argue that I did not effectively communicate my frustration at receiving the Captain's emails. 

I concede to his point that using the block sender option is, eminently, the most reasonable choice - however, I never said I was a reasonable person, and I feel it would be rude to waste his bandwidth by sending an email to an inbox that will never receive it. Assuming that I would contact "the school" to be removed from an email list, when in all forms of communication, Captain Slurs emphasizes the degree to which he would love to be in touch, feels reductive at best and downright wrong at worst. How am I supposed to figure that to be removed from your email list, I should go to somebody else down the street? Why would I not ask you? Clearly, me and dear Dom have different opinions on a reasonable response.

To conclude, if you just skipped to the bottom: Send an email back to someone who's annoying you with communication you never asked for. You just might laugh.

(As a note, this is a full 0% AI. I would never delegate a ~~shitpost~~ task of this magnitude to a machine)
