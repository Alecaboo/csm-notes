How have you grown as a Peer Mentor and what excites you about continuing in this role?

In my time as a peer mentor, I feel that I made the progress in connecting with students as they were going through Helluva Welcome as well as the rest of the first semester. As a sophomore, I had the experience of y'know, doing Oredigger camp and the rest of the kickoff process just a year before I started officiating it, so I felt that I had the peer part of peer mentor down pat, and this year was great for making progress in the mentor part of it. I'm excited to continue being a peer mentor because now that I have that added experience in being a mentor, so can keep rolling that added mentor experience forward while maintaining the peer part.

Reflect on a significant moment that shaped your time as a Peer Mentor. How has this moment influenced the Peer Mentor you have become?

One of my more significant moments as a peer mentor was when some of my mentees were involved in one of my extracurriculars on campus, and due to some extenuating circumstances within said extracurricular, they were feeling unwelcome and not like a part of the group. One of my mentees came to be after a rehearsal and confided that they were worried that people didn't like them, they weren't part of the group, so on and so forth. I took this opportunity to be a resource for my mentee because they were quite clearly struggling, and they trusted me as both a confidant and as a just a general peer, so I was able to effectively make them feel more welcome through a combination of the positions I held and generally just being a resource for my mentees.

What lessons do you believe are most important within CSM101? How did teaching them impact your perspective?

I absolutely believe that the most important CSM101 lesson was registration - it's definitely a bit of a mundane one, but it does have one of the larger impacts on the future of their time at Mines, and being the person who goes "this is important, here's what I've learned from doing this so you don't have to learn the same lessons" is one of my favorite parts of the Peer Mentor job in general, and being able to drill down on a specific, concrete thing and make sure it doesn't cause problems for my mentees was great. I had a great experience being taught some of these lessons by my previous mentors, and now being on the other side of that perspective was both interesting to see myself in my previous mentor's shoes, and a good experience because I feel that I did a good job of perpetuating a similar experience forward for my mentees.

Share one leadership quality that you are proud to have exemplified as a Peer Mentor. How did you demonstrate this quality throughout the year?

Approachability - I feel that I did a fine job of being a *peer* mentor, who was an authority figure that my mentees could reach out to for actual advice, but also a peer that they could approach as a friend without all of the necessary baggage of dealing with an authority figure. I feel that this was an area that I didn't necessarily improve in - I feel like I was fairly approachable throughout the entire semester, and was consistently available as a person for my mentees to talk to, so did my best to keep that vibe up from Helluva Welcome to finals week.

Share one leadership quality that you want to grow into throughout the next year. What are some steps you would take to successfully improve your skills?

I'm worried that I may have swung too far into being "chill and approachable," and that I may not have been serious enough for my mentees to know that I was also, like, a serious resource, and not just their institutionally mandated friend. I think the foremost steps I have to take in order to make that a reality is just generally in the vibe with which I operate - a smidge less smiling and jokes, a bit more being serious regarding some of the topics. It's not that I was incapable of being serious - especially for some of the mental health lectures, I feel that me and my tripod did successfully convey a vibe of seriousness, but still something I feel that I should work.

Think about a leadership or mentorship position you have held outside of the Peer Mentor program. How have you used lessons from that experience within the Peer Mentor role? _(Please remember not to use specific organization or position names)_

I've spent a lot of time on campus in a leadership position where I have to deal with a lot of very stressed people, so one lesson I've taken from that is properly managing my own stress, particularly when dealing with stressed people. It can be really easy when talking or working with someone who's stressed to end up going down some form of spiral and just getting generally stressed out, so figuring out how to effectively help manage other people's stress without being overly empathetic and falling in to the pitfall of excessive stress myself is a big takeaway for me. This came up in my time as a Peer Mentor because a lot of the times when my mentees would be reaching out to me for help, they would be doing so because they were some degree of stressed or worried about something, so in a lot of my interactions as a Peer Mentor, I had to keep not being overly stressed myself in mind. 

Share an example of when you exercised empathy towards diverse identities and explain why you believe this is important to the Peer Mentor role.

Several of my mentees this semester were dealing with their gender identity and figuring out who they wanted to be, so doing absolutely everything I could to be supportive and helpful, even as they may have asked to use a different name or different set of pronouns. Peer Mentors are uniquely situated to be able to be supportive because we are peers, it's really easy to directly empathize with our mentees, but we're also authority figures, so our support is great for helping "validate" the feelings and emotions of our mentees - not that their feelings are any less valid if I didn't hear them, but being able to help actualize a portion of their feelings is and was an excellent and important part of the peer mentor role.
