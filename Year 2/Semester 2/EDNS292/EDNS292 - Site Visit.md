- Again, deep apologies at how late all of this is.
	- Second apology: We forgot to take any pictures! We were unfortunately very locked in to the entire conversation, so, to instead recount:
#### Getting There
- Getting there was generally pretty straightforward, get on the highway, drive down, etc, etc, except for one tiny wrinkle that the address just pointed us to a lighting company with an electric gate that was too heavy to move by hand, so we just kind of circled the building a few times. Eventually, we saw a loading truck go in a back entrance, and proceeded to follow the truck route and eventually buzzed our way to the door. We got a very confused look or two, and then made it the door and successfully buzzed our way in.
### The Rest of It
- We started by getting a tour of their warehouse, where we got to see their entire inventory, including various projects Apollo is currently working on. One of the biggest challenges of home solar installations is different kinds of roofing - certain kinds of stone-adjacent roofing require essentially the entire roof to be ripped up, and Apollo is doing their best (being lead by a former roofing technican) to make those jobs remotely financially feasible. We also got some supply chain insights, and, surprisingly, they aren't really worried  about current tariffs and such due to working partially through American suppliers, who then have to deal with some of the Tariffs, but with the current tax code being locked in and being far enough down the chain, they're not too stressed.
- After the full warehouse/garage tour, we ended up going up to their office, and meeting the entirety of the team that was still at that point, which was a lovely time.
- We then went into their conference room, and got a delightful tour through a shockingly large amount of company files managed through Google Drive, including the ledger of different permits they have to keep up, the various presentations they utilize to attempt to sway customers, as well as general leaflets and such

### Overall Reflection
- By and large a really good site visit - I feel that I (we) get a lot of information about a stakeholder group we hadn't really talked to as much, and we had a good time doing it (and got free merch!). I had kinda been doubtful on how useful a site visit would be, but having a somewhat bored stakeholder who works as a salesman while also having an engineering background was *awesome* for just getting a metric ton of information. Getting to see the warehouse and piles of uninstalled equipment and what's kept on hand was also fascinating, as I'm not really sure where else I could've possibly gotten said experience.
