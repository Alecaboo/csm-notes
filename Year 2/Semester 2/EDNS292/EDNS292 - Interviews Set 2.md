## Interview Link
- Same link, only got one scheduled this week, but also actually got done the interview that was on the last check in just kind of lobbing emails around https://mines0.sharepoint.com/:p:/t/GRP-EDNS292-Spring2025/Ea0hOrWg1_1NvQ_DPQuf7nsBAelEcbcBy_YaHBeeggWPqw?email=awigner%40mines.edu&e=jHige2


## Informational Interview
- Heard my first positive response back from someone in a "robot engineering" position - working out scheduling logistics, but should have that completed pretty soon!
