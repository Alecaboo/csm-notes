- Student experience - waiting in lines
	- This one was less distinct interview but I did gather from the rest of my team (and my own experience) where a lot of career fair this year (especially the second day) was waiting in some variety of line. One potential solution could be some form of "return time," especially for the longer lines, where you scan into some form of digital queue and get a callback when the employer is actually ready to receive you. 
- Employers - HR Reps unable to answer engineering specific questions
	- Honestly, I think the solution here is an internal company one - try to encourage more technically capable people into human relations. Fundamentally, I feel like it's easier to train an engineer to be able to answer company culture questions and do their part in HR than it is to train an HR person on answering engineer questions - I could be wrong though! Which leads to the follow up solution idea of...
- Employers - Engineers less willing/able to answer company values questions
	- Honestly, I think the solution here is an internal company one - try to encourage more engineers to be personable and able to interact from a company values standpoint as well as train HR reps on more specifics of what the company does from an engineering standpoint, especially if they're being sent to regularly talk to aspiring engineers / employees. 
- Employers - Practice / Expectations for questions asked
	- We experienced a good bit of like actual shock when we asked to just ask questions, not at all angling for "get a career," which, given that we were at a Career Fair, is honestly a fair perspective, but regardless - implement more training on the networking/understanding angle of questions that many students end up asking at career fair. While we may have been a bit more formalized than most, many students ask networking/understanding style questions, so preparing companies more to deal with those questions instead of looks of abject terror (like the Seaboard engineer that I interviewed).
