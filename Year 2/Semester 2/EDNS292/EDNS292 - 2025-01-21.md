## i did not take notes during the interview so this is me attempting to synthesize afterwards
- Question asked was really "so uh, what do you do" and then a couple of prompting questions
- really really big on mornings, woke up at 5 today, went for a swim, went to a group prayer, locked in at the library, and then came here for class
- spring semseter of freshman year realized that mornings were when he gets most of his productivity done, so organized schedule to be locked in in those early mornings since past 6-7pm productivity and level of locked in goes :LiArrowBigDownDash:
- big fan of how peaceful it is in the morning, low number of cars
- enjoys swimming, like not just as an exercise thing but also in general
- read the gunslinger (dark tower 1) by stephen king and was kind of confused by it, likes to understand why books are the way they are and are happening the way they are - example given was percy jackson ending up on an island making sense
