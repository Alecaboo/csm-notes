### two dimensional particle equilibrium
$$\sum\limits F=0$$
- "Steeper Angle, Bigger Tension"

#### Get Springy Wit it
- $F=ks$, it's Hooke's Law, you know and love it.
	- ($s$ is the stretch in the spring, $k$ is the spring constant {stiffness} \[usually lb/in or N/m])
- Ya want some springs, kid?
- Springs don't change equilibrium

#### Pulleys
- Pulleys have your average component shenanigans, the tension on both ends of the pulley are always the same and the sum of the forces has to manage to equal zero.

#### Exampling Time
![[Statics 5.1]]
- Hey, at current we have a bit of a problem: three unknowns but only two equations
- Two potential ways to remedy this:
	- Get up to geometric *shenanigans*
	- Or draw another free body diagram
- Oh hey, we sure do have a triangle with SAS given, and we're trying to find some funky other things
$$\ell_{AC}^{2}= 2^{2}+4^{2}-2*2*4\cos60$$
$$\ell_{AC}= 3.46\text{ ft}$$
$$\theta_{C}= 30\degree$$
- I mean we used law of cosines, but we also have adjacent and hypotenuse and 2/4 is in fact 0.5... y'know nevermind. Don't make assumptions.
- Oh hey, now we've chopped down to two unknowns with two equations. Ain't that neat.
$$\sum\limits F_{x}=0 ( \to_{+})$$
$$-F_{AB}\cos(60)+F_{AC}\cos(30)=0$$
$$\sum\limits F_{y}= 0 ( \uparrow_{+})$$
$$F_{AB}\sin(60)+F_{AC}\sin(30)-80=0$$
- Do Algebra and solve that. I have faith.
	- Reportedly, $F_{AC}$ is 40 lb. 
		- Can get Hooke-y with it, $\frac{40lb}{50 \frac{lb}{ft}}=0.8ft$, and then the unstretched length is going to be actual minus stretched, or $\ell_{o}=3.46-0.8=2.66ft$
