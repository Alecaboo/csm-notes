## Straight Trussing It.
- Cheap, easy, *and* strong. Holly jolly.
### Special Properties of Trusses
- :LiTriangle: are massive.
	- I mean like we love :LiTriangle: up in here
		- Why do anything else when you could have :LiTriangleRight:
- It's :LiPin:s all the way down.
	- Note from later in the lecture: This whole "all pin" thing is bullshit. They just gotta act pin-ish as long as they're two force.
- All loads are applied at the joints.
	- If you apply a load at the beam, it becomes a multiforce member
	- Also, we're ignoring the weight of the truss members.
- All two force members in trusses.
- If forces pull a member apart it's under tension, it's under compression otherwise.
#### How do we do these things?
- That's right. You guessed it. We do an FBD of the whole damn thing.
	- You're never gonna guess. $\sum F_{x}=0,\sum F_{y }=0,\sum F_{z}=0,\sum M=0$
- Do FBD of a joint to find forces in the members of the truss.
	- Assume any unknown is in tension.
		- You like, could assume that everything's under compression, but this creates a sign convention where positive is tension is negative is compression.
		- Each joint only has $\sum F_{x}=0, \sum F_{y}=0$
			- It's basically a particle, there are no distances, so ya can't do moments. Womp to the womp.
### Example Time
![[Statics First Truss Diagram]]
- We want to find force in DH, CD, CH, CG, CB, GH, and find all zero force members.
#### First up is an FBD of the whole thing to find support reactions.

$$
\sum M_{A}=0
$$
$$
C_{y}(54)-1.96(81)=0
$$
$$
\boxed{
C_{y}=2.94N
}
$$
$$
\sum F_{y}=0
$$
$$
A_{y}+C_{y}-4.91-1.96=0
$$
$$
\boxed{
A_{y}=3.93N
}
$$
$$
\sum F_{x}=0,\sum F_{x}=A_{x}=0
$$
#### Pick an FBD of a Joint with Knowns and not two many unknowns.
![[CEEN241 - 2025-02-28 2025-02-28 10.37.02.excalidraw]]
- How howdy. Doesn't it look like we only two unknowns? Ain't that neat
$$
\sum F_{y}=0, 0 = 1.96 - DH\sin(45)
$$
$$
DH = -2.77 N
$$
- Oh hey, a negative means we're under compression. Neato.
$$
\sum F_{x}=0, \ -2.77\cos(45)=CD
$$
$$
CD = 1.96 N
$$
#### Now we keep on joint chopping. I want a nap.
![[CEEN241 - 2025-02-28 2025-02-28 10.44.39.excalidraw]]
$$
2.77\cos(45)=HG
$$
$$
HG = -1.96 N
$$
$$
HC = 2.77\sin(45)
$$
$$
HC = 1.96 N
