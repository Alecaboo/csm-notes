## Frames (and comparing them to Trusses)
- We now have loading in between joints (trusses just had them at the joints)
- Here we look at FBDs of individual members or of groups of members
- No cuts (method of sections) through multiforce members

#### Textbook Example 6.9
![[Statics textbook 6.9]]
1. ID all member types
2. ID all possible FBDs 
3. Use equilibrium equations to solve

#### FBD of the whole
![[CEEN241 - 2025-03-10 2025-03-10 10.14.03.excalidraw]]
#### FBD of AB
![[CEEN241 - 2025-03-10 2025-03-10 10.15.59.excalidraw]]
### FBD of AC
![[CEEN241 - 2025-03-10 2025-03-10 10.17.29.excalidraw]]
- Solution is to go off the FBD of the whole, find $\sum M_{A}$, find $C_{y}$, find $\sum F_{y}=0$, find $A_{y}$
	- Just go FBD by FBD, knocking out what you can with the knowns you got until you get more knowns and can keep going

### Textbook Problem 6.102
![[CEEN241 - 2025-03-10 2025-03-10 10.29.47.excalidraw]]
![[CEEN241 - 2025-03-10 2025-03-10 10.35.45.excalidraw]]
$$
\sum M_{A}=0
$$
$$
-490.5(0.8m)-490.5(1.6)m - C_{y}(1.6m)=0
$$
$$
C_{y}=-735.75N
$$
- Negative just means the opposite of how it's drawn 

![[CEEN241 - 2025-03-10 2025-03-10 10.45.17.excalidraw]]
$$
\sum M_{D}=0=490.5(0.7)-735.75(1.6)+C_{x}(1.2)
$$
$$
C_{x}=694.88N
$$
