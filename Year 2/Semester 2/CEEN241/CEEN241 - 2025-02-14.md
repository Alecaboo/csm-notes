## Rigid Body 2D FBDs
- We're isolating the system from the rest of the world, and replacing any physical supports with forces & moments.
- In order to do this, we gotta ask:
	- What does the support prevent?
	- What does the support allow?
- If the support prevents translation, then we replace it with a force reaction.
- If the support prevents rotation, then we replace it with a moment reaction.

### Connections and Supports, oh my
#### Smooth Pin / Hinge
- Does... fuck all to rotation. Spin like crazy.
- Translation though? We stopping translation.
#### Roller
- Does nothing to translation parallel to it, but prevents translation down through it. (Perpendicular)
###### Rocker
- Basically the same as a roller
#### Fixed Support
- They just stick beams into the ground really hard. It can't go anywhere. It's crazy.

### Connections
#### Cable
- Can only support pulling forces
#### Weightless Link (Two Force Member)
- Same vibe as a cable, line of action has to be along the thingy.

#### Frictionless (Smooth) Contact
- Allowed to move along, not allowed to move in, same vibe as a roler/rocker
### Weird Shit
#### Roller or Pin in Slot
- Allowed to move up and down in slot, but can't exit the slot

#### Member Pin on Smooth Rod
- Can move up and down on rod, but can't go through the rod

### Moving on 
- We're maintaining the same counterclockwise being positive sign convention.
- Lots of other discussion that i took no notes from


### Two Force Members

![[Statics Two Force Member Initial]]
- If there are only two locations on a rigid object with forces and no moments, you've got yourself a two force member.
- Line of action of reaction force always goes from Location 1 to Location 2
- If there are more than two locations, it's what we in the business call a 
### Multiforce Member
- More than two locations with forces *or* a moment applied anywhere on the system
-
