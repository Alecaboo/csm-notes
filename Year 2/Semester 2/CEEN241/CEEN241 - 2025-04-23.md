##### Not a word about the dates or missing content between this and the last note.

- Polar moment of inertia is for torsion, all you really need to know is that $J=Ix+Iy$, and that's literally all you care about.
### Parallel Axis Theorem
![[CEEN241 - 2025-04-23 2025-04-23 10.14.36.excalidraw]]
- If we did the math, we'd find that $Ix'=\frac{1}{12}bh^{3}$
	- and that $Iy'=\frac{1}{12}b^{3}h$
- And we have symmetry, so $Ix'y'=0$, which just means that one of them is the most and one of them is the least.

### Equations for Parallel Axis Theorem 
- These let us find equations for any axis that's parallel to our original, ie what's marked in red
$$
\boxed{
Ix=Ix'+A*d_{y}^{2}
}
$$
$$
\boxed{
Iy=Iy'+A*d_{x}^{2}
}
$$
$$
\boxed{
Ixy=Ix'y'+A*dx*dy
}
$$
#### Signs on dx and dy
- Based on the coordinate of the $x'y'$ origin in the $x-y$ system.

### Example
![[CEEN241 - 2025-04-23 2025-04-23 10.25.32.excalidraw]]
- Deflection, $\delta$, is an equation that I just barely missed writing down. Motherfucker.
- For our solution, we're just going to use the classic $I=I'+Ad^{2}$
- Before we can actually do anything, we do in fact need to find centroid.
	- Step 1a, draw $x_{1}',y'$, and $x-y$ axes
	- As well as $\tilde{x},\tilde{y}$ for all yo segments
		- Gotta be measured from the same edge as $\bar{y}$ (or like $\bar{x}$)
$$
\bar{y}=\frac{\tilde{y}_{1}A_{1}+\tilde{y}_{2}A_{2}}{A_{1}+A_{2}}
$$
$$
A_{1}=5*2=10, A_{2}=3*12=36
$$
$$
\tilde{y}_{1}=4, \tilde{y}_{2}=1.5
$$
- Plug it all in, you get that $\bar{y}=2.04$ inches
- Go forth and use a table for the parallel axis theorem
