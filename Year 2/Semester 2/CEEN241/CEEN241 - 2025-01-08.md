## Big topic of the day is vectors
#### we start with a quick clicker(s)?
- Pounds are a force. Crazy.
#### Housekeeping stuff
- Homework exists, and I'm probably going to need to go get in an argument.
- Go to any recitation, hands on activities start next week, they're basically office hours+

### okie vector time
![[Statics Day2Sketch1]]
- Oh, we weren't even doing anything. Brutal.

- Delightful news! Everything is 2d. For right now. Literally just right now. Friday is 3d.
	- So, what's going on with vectors?
![[Statics Day2Sketch2Realsies]]
- The textbook doesn't use hat or vector signs! They use bold font, because fuck you, that's why.
- Talking about "a couple other tools" with respect to vectors
	- Corresponding angles
		![[Statics Corresponding Angles]]
		- On that alternate interior angles type shit
	- Law of Sines and Cosines (for when we have a general triangle)
		- By "general" we mean anything that's not a right triangle. We can go suck a toe or something for right triangles.
		- ![[Statics Law of Sines n' Cosines]]
		- Law of sines is just saying that $$\frac{\sin\alpha}{A}=\frac{\sin\beta}{B}$$
			- You can do the same thing for any of them (ie $\frac{\sin\alpha}{A}=\frac{\sin\gamma}{C}$)
				- For completeness's sake, you can also do $\frac{\sin\gamma}{C}=\frac{\sin\beta}{B}$ 
		- Law of Cosines is a bit more of a pain
			- $A^{2}= B^{2}+C^{2}$ 
				- We start off looking like the Pythagorean theorem. Easy. Reliable. Got it. Love it.
				- However.
			- $A^{2}=B^{2}+C^{2}-2(BC)\cos(\alpha)$
				- This is essentially our pythagorean theorem, times two times (what's on the right) multiplied by the cosine of the angle on the left.
					- If you go crazy and start reorganizing, you end up with
						- $B^{2}=A^{2}+C^{2}- 2ACC\cos(\beta)$
						- $C^{2}=A^{2}+B^{2}-2AB\cos(\gamma)$
- "We want to have the least number of math to do"
	- Neither math nor english is our strong suit.
## Alright example problem time
![[Statics Day2Problem1]]
- Given all that, find the resultant vectors.
- We want to find the magnitude and direction (maybe we can get to stealing the moon at some point) of our resultant vector
	- We have a couple different solutions
		- You could go tip to tail.
		- I personally fuck way more with components, especially for this problem, but regardless.

### okie new problem (2.2 in the textbook)
![[Statics Day2Problem2]]
- Go crazy with parallelograms, is how you go about doing this one
	- The video reportedly does finish it
