## Distributed Loads
![[Statics Distributed Big Snow]]
$$w = 40\frac{\text{lb}}{\text{ft}^{2}}(0.75\text{ft})$$
$$w = 30 \text{ lb/ft}$$
- This is equivalent to some concentrated force, and, quite unfortunately, we need some concentrated force in order to do moments or any of the other fun stuff that we generally do.
	- The centroid here is just going to be the middle, and $F_{r}$ is just going to be the area of our shape.
$$F_{R} = 30 \text{ lb/ft }(10\text{ ft})=300\text{ lb}$$

#### Triangular Load
- If our snow was instead a triangular setup, with some $w$ equal to 100 lb/ft on the upper end of our triangle, and 0 lb/ft on the lower end of our triangle, with an $L$ still of ten feet, it's still just the area, right? $$\frac{1}{2}10\text{ ft} * 100 \text{ lb/ft }= 500 \text{ lb}$$
- The force would be acting itself over at $\frac{2}{3} 10$ft 

#### Trapezoidal Load
![[Trapezoidal Distributed Load]]
- That's, essentially, a rectangle and a triangle snipped together.
	- So the triangular bit is just going to be $F_{R1}=\frac{1}{2}(10\text{ft})(50\text{lb/ft})$
	- And then the rectangle is going to be $F_{R2}=10\text{ft}(25\text{lb/ft})$
	- And then ya smack em together and bob's your uncle.
		- Also they're acting at their respective centroids, so it's marginally more complicated, but don't worry too much.

### Egg

- Wow, I biffed this scale *bad*
- We're looking for equivalent resultant force and where it's acting from relative to $A$
- Alrighty, so actually solving this:
	- Sure looks awfully like we have a rectangle and a triangle.
		- Rectangle on the right would just be $60$ lb/ft * $6$ft, giving us a balmy 360 lb acting right around 13 ft from $A$
		- Triangle on the left would be a delightful $\frac{1}{2}b*h$, where we have $\frac{1}{2}10*60=300$lb, acting at 6.67 ft from $A$
	- So the total magnitude of our force is just going to be 660 lb.
		- We need our distance though, so the sum of our initial moments was 6681 lb\*ft,  so, you go and divide that by 660, and you get that the resultant force is acting right about 10.12 ft from $A$
