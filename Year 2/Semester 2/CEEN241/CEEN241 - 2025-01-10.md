## y'know that bit about moving to 3d? we're moving to 3d.

### First up is dealing with angles and cosines and such
#### I'm a liar, we're doing cartesian vectors in 2d. We'll get there.
![[Statics Day3Sketch1]]
#### Ok *now* we're moving to 3d. I promise.
- why in the sweet kentucky fried hell is y up. we're not minecraft. what is happening here.
![[Statics Day3Sketch2]]
- This makes it so that we end up with something like $$\vec{F}= 200\cos\alpha\hat\imath + 200 \cos\beta\hat{\jmath}+200\cos\gamma\hat{k}$$
$$\vec{F}=200(\cos\alpha\ \hat{\imath} + \cos\beta \ \hat{\jmath} + \cos\gamma \ \hat{k})$$
- Other important bits
	- $|\vec{u}|=1.0$ (the magnitude of a unit vector is 1)
		- And, a unit vector is unitless! How silly.
	- $\vec{F}=200\text{lb}\ \cdot \vec{u}\to\text{lb}$ 
- I dunno where we're going with this, so
	$$\cos\alpha = \frac{\text{adj}}{\text{hyp}}=\frac{F_{x}}{F}, \cos\beta = \frac{F_{y}}{F}, \cos\gamma = \frac{F_{z}}{F}$$
	$$\vec{u} = \frac{F_x\hat\imath + F_{y}\hat{\jmath}+ F_{z}\hat{k}}{F}$$
	- Wow, just wrote the same thing like three times. Shit crazy.
### Position Vector Time (Coordinates)
![[Statics Day3Sketch3]]
- Just as a note here, there's no way the $z$ coordinate is correct. If we're just throwing sense out the window, we should call the $x$ coordinate 2.
$$\vec{F} = F\cdot \vec{u}$$
$$\vec{u} = \frac{\vec{r}_{AB}}{r_{AB}}$$
$$\vec{r}_{AB}=(x_{B}-x_{A})\hat\imath+ (y_{B}-y_A )\hat{\jmath}+(z_{B}-z_{A})\hat{k}$$
$$\vec{r}_{AB} = (5-0)\hat{\imath}+ (3-0)\hat{j}+(10-0)\hat{k}$$
$$\vec{u}_{AB} = \frac{\vec{r}_{AB}}{r_{AB}}=\ <5,3,10>$$
$$= \frac{<5,3,10>}{\sqrt{5^{2}+ 3^{2}+10 ^{2}}}= \frac{<5,3,10>}{\sqrt{134}}$$
$$\vec{u}_{AB} = 0.43\hat\imath + 0.26 \hat\jmath + 0.86 \hat{k}$$
$$\vec{F} = 200\ \vec{u}_{AB}= 86\ \hat\imath + 52\ \hat\jmath +172\ \hat{k}\text{ lb} $$
- Y'know what. Fuck you. Also find $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ 
	- This is actually really easy - just $\arccos$ of what we got for our components over the big force
		- $\alpha = \arccos(0.43)=64.5\degree$
		- $\beta = \arccos(0.26)=74.9\degree$
		- $\gamma=\arccos(0.86)=30.7\degree$
### Planar Projections<sub>the one I don't actually like</sub>
![[Statics 3.4]]
On that stair shit (some steps)
1. Find lines parallel to $x,y,z$
2. Find right angles (oh hey, we made two right triangles)
	- That will always be two right triangles for planar projection.
3.
