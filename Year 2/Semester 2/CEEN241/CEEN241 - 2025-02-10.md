## Dealing with centroids and other such fun
- We often care about the average between two things
- Center of a rectangle is, quite shockingly, half the radius and half the height.
![[Statics centroid shenanigans]]
- We want to find $\bar{x}$ and $\bar{y}$
- The trick is really just to break this into components (I'm working backwards, and was busy doing comp sci)
- For that circle with the funky negative area, let's just worry about the outside
	- $r=1.5ft$
	- $A_{2}=\pi \frac{r^{2}}{2}=3.53ft^{2}$
	- $\tilde{x} = - \frac{4r}{3\pi}=-0.64$ft
	- $\tilde{y}=+r=+1.5$
- For the inside bit of it, 
	- $\tilde{x}_{3}= \frac{-4r}{3\pi}=-0.53ft$
	- $\tilde{y}_{3}=1.5$ft
	- $A_{3}= -\frac{\pi r^{2}}{2}=-2.65$ft
- For the triangle, it's just $\frac{1}{3}$ of our bits and bobs, meaning $\tilde{x}$ and $\tilde{y}$ are both 1ft

$$\bar{x} = \frac{\tilde{x}A_{1}+\tilde{x}_{2}A_{2}+ \tilde{x}_{3}A_{3}}{A_{1}+ A_{2}+ A_{3}}= \frac{1*4.5 + -0.64*3.53 + -0.53*-2.65}{4.5 +3.53 -2.65}= 0.678ft$$
$$\bar{y} = \frac{\tilde{y}_{1}A_{1}+ \tilde{y}_{2}A_{2}+ \tilde{y}_{3}A_{3}}{A_{1}+A_{2}+ A_{3}}= \frac{1(4.5) + 1.5(3.53) + 1.5(-2.65)}{4.5 + 3.53 - 2.65}= 1.08ft$$

- New example, given:
![[Statics T centroid]]
- Line of symmetry down the middle was added, that's where $\bar{x}$ is going to be (at 3, by the by)
- I like splitting this fine fella into two rectangles
- Alright, so I care about the y coordinates, measured from the top, essentially, so that top one has a $\tilde{y}$ of 0.5 and an area of $6$
	- The bottom rectangle, on the other hand, would have a $\tilde{y}$ of $3$ and an area of $4$
- So we're looking at $$\frac{\tilde{y}_{1}A_{1} + \tilde{y}_{2}A_{2}}{A_{1}+A_{2}}= \frac{0.5(6) + 3(4)}{6+4)}= \frac{3 + 12}{10}= 1.5in=\bar{y}$$
