## Doing Machines, which are basically just frames
- The bucket of a backhoe and it's contents have a weight of 1200 lb and a center o fgravity at G. Determine the forces of the hydraulic cylinder AB and in links AC and AD in order to hold the load in the position shown. The bucket is pinned at E
![[fucked up bucket backhoe]]
- Find AB, AC, and AD
	- Wow, I hate that drawing, a lot

| Rigid Object | Type           |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| AC           | 2 force member |
| AD           | 2 force member |
| AB           | 2 force member |
| ECG          | Multi          |
| EDB          | Multi          |
- FBD of ECG has a known and makes a great place to start (ok how the fuck do we actually draw it now)

$$
F_{AC}\sin(30)(1ft) + F_{ac}\cos(30)(0.25ft) - 1200(1.5)ft = 0
$$
$$
F_{AC}=+2512.2 \ lb
$$
- We could solve for $E_{x}$ and $E_{y}$ by just using $\sum F_{x}=0$, but they're not asking, so lowkey.... don't care.
- FBD at joint A (this is what I tried to do and did wrong on one of the homeworks. jo comprendo.)

$$
\sum F_{y}=0
$$
$$
AB\sin(45)+AC\cos(30)=0
$$
$$
AB = -3076.8 \ lb
$$
$$
\sum F_{x}=0
$$
$$
AB\cos(45) + AD - AC\sin(30)= 0 
$$
$$
-3076.8 \cos(45) + AD - 2512.2\sin(30)=0
$$
$$
AD = 3431.72 \ lb
$$
