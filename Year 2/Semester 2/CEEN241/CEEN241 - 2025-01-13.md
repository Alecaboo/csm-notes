## shenanigans with the dot product
- also, when did he pick up a stake? did I miss a vampire event? has that been here the whole time? does he just walk around with a stake in his backpack? who does he think he is, andres van helsing?

- Given that they're concurrent, we can do the dot product, which, mathematically, is $$\vec{A}\cdot \vec{B} = A*B \cos(\theta)$$
	- Standard dot product bits, $A$ and $B$ are magnitudes, we get a scalar out, you do $A_{x}*B_{x}+A_{y}*B_{y}+ A_{z}*B_{z}$, and that works out nice and neat.
- Reportedly, two important applications:
	1. We can find $\theta$! $\theta=\cos^{-1}(\frac{\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}}{A*B})$
		- That literally just comes from solving the existing dot product equation for theta. Sure is neat.
			- Magnitudes are standard magnitude business.
#### Parallel and Perpendicular Components
![[Statics 4.2]]
- If we want to actually get this, $F_{\text{AontoAB}}=\vec{F}_{A}\cdot\vec{u}_{AB}=\text{Scalar!}$ 
	- If we really want to get $\vec{F}_{\text{AontoAB}}$, you just multiply by the unit vector ($F_{\text{AontoAB}}\cdot\vec{u}_{AB}$), and that spits out your vector
- Alright alright, that was the parallel part, now get $\perp$ with it.
	- Note: You always find the parallel first. Sorry bub, just how it goes.
	- $F_{A}^{2}=(F_{\text{AontoAB}})^{2}+(F_{\perp AB})^{2}$
		- I love the pythagorean theorem.
		- So you solve, and $F_{\perp AB}=\sqrt{F_{A}^{2}-(F_{\text{AontoAB}})^{2}}$ 
	- To get the vector, you just have $\vec{F}_{A}=\vec{F}_{\text{AontoAB}}+\vec{F}_{\perp AB}$ 
		- So you solve, $\vec{F}_{\perp AB}=\vec{F}_{A}-\vec{F}_{\text{A onto AB}}$ 
- The general vibe is here is that the components add back to the original $F_{A}$ 
#### egg sample time
##### Given:
![[Statics 4.3]]
- Point C is Chekov's Stake, driven in to the wall.
	- I am being threatened.
##### Find:
- Components of AB parallel and perpendicular to AC. (Scalar and Vector)

##### Solution:
$$F_{\text{ABontoAC}}=\vec{F}_{AB} \cdot\vec{u}_{AC}$$
$$\vec{u}_{AC} = \frac{\vec{r}_{AC}}{r_{AC}} = \frac{<-0.2,0.3,-0.93>}{\sqrt{0.2^{2}+ 0.3^{2}+0.93^{2}}}= <-0.2,0.3,-0.93>$$
$$F_{\text{ABontoAC}}=<82,52,172> \cdot <-0.2,0.3,-0.93> = -17.2 + 15.6 - 159.96 = -161.6 \text{ lb}$$
- That silly little negative number is telling us that we're going in the exact opposite of the direction of the unit vector
- If we hang on to the sign, and do 
$$\vec{F}_{\text{AontoAB}}=-161.6\vec{u}_{AC}=32.32\ \hat{\imath}, -48.48 \ \hat{\jmath}, 150.3 \ \hat{k}$$
- Now get perpendicular with it

$$F_{\perp AC}= \sqrt{200^{2}- (161.6)^{2}}= 117.84$$
$$\vec{F}_{\perp AC}= \vec{F}_{AB}- \vec{F}_{\text{ABontoAC}}$$
