## Equivalent Systems
<sub>also, housekeeping, who steals a semi assigned seat at this point in the semester?</sub>
![[Statics 9.1]]
- So we want to take this system, and replace those multiple forces with an equivalent force somewhere in the middle

### Two Rules for Equivalency
1. Applied forces in original must be equal to applied forces in resultant ($F_{R} = F_{1}+F_{2}$)
	- In our case, that means $F_{R}$ is 14.7N
2. Moments from the _applied_ forces in original about any point must be the same as the moment from the applied forces in the equivalent about the same point
	- This means in our case we should get 54cm

### Second Way of doing things
- Get asked to replace OG with a force and a moment at a point
	- "Replace $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ with $F_{R}$ and M at point A"
	- End up needing to add some couple moment, $M_{a}$, in order to make the systems equivalent

### Example
![[Statics 9.2]]
- replace with an equivalent force and specify its location along AC measured from A.
	- Alrighty, combination time
		- And by combination, I really mean we're going to split things apart 
$$F_{Rx}= -100\cos(30) + 200\cos(60)= 13.4lb$$
$$F_{Ry}=100\sin(30)+200\sin(60) = 223.21 lb$$
- What I reaaaally care about is the moments, to be so real.
$$M_{og}=100\sin(30)*3 - 200*\cos(60)*3 +200\sin(60)*5$$
$$M_{og}= \cancel{716.025} = 100*\sin(30)*3 - 200*\cos(60)*3 + 200*\sin(60 )*5 +50 = 766.025$$
- And then solving for the distance we only really care about the $F_{Ry}$ because of how rotation works, so $\frac{766.025}{223.21}=3.43$
