## housekeeping stuff
- hands on 1 & 2 are available before feb 4th, so, probably go do that
- recitations end 5pm on exam days, fun fact
	- also the exam is feb 4th

## hey wait a sec, gimme a moment
- i am going insane. 
	- please see [[MATH112 - 2024-01-26]] and [[PHGN 100 - 2024-02-28]]
- if I had a nickel for every british crane we saw dunk itself into the water, I'd have two nickels, which isn't a lot, but, y'know
- we now have rigid objects that resist compression (ie, you push on it) and bending <sub>amon type shit</sub>
- moments cause a tendency for objects to rotate $$m = F*d$$
- where d is perpendicular to the line of action of $F$ and goes to the point of interest
![[Statics 7.1]]
#### moment vectors
- these point in the direction of the axis of rotation
![[Statics 7.1.2]]
- We use the right hand rule to figure this out (the curly variation)
	- fairly certain it also works out using the perpendicular one if you put one finger on line of action of the force and the other along the distance, but, anyways
- "fingers towards your palm will never do you wrong" is a nice rhyme
	- so help me if someone has not heard of lefty loosey righty tighty in their sophomoreish year of an engineering program i have QUESTIONS
## ohhhh nooo! just broke my coordinate system!
#### ok jokes aside, principle of transmissibility
- we can use any point on the line of action to calculate the moment
- ![[Statics 7.3]]
- Fun fact! $F_{x}$ ain't doing shit to cause us to rotate (it's acting right along the axis. this is regular ol' torque/moment stuff)
- $F_{y}$, on the other hand, is getting up to some grand old shennanigans of $F_{y}(2m)$, which then just means the moment about A is just going to be $10\sin(55)*2m=16.4kN-m$ 
- Counterclockwise is always positive in 2D 

### egg sample
![[Statics 7.4]]
- Find the moment about A
- Okies, so you break into components
	- $F_{x}= 500\cos(35)$
	- and $F_{y}=500\sin(35)$
- From your components, you can pick your force ($500\cos(35)$, in our case), and then you just have to pick your distance (which is just going to be our 2ft, per the transmissibility  shenanigans)
- minor problem, we do also have the other component kicking it around, and that does matter, so that'll be $500\sin(35)*6ft$ 
	- $y$ forces will always have an $x$ distance and vice versa, and that will *always* be the case
		- signs with tendency to rotate (right hand rule or CCW convention)
- If you run the numbers, $m_{A}$ is going to be $-819.2+1720.7=901.6$ft, which is positive, so clockwise

- Even when you get up to some geometric shenanigans, you really well and truly just care about what's happening perpendicular relative to the point - if you have a big ol' elbow getting up to some mischief, that really doesn't matter
