### moment at an axis
- Find the moment at any point along the axis of interest
- Which is going to be $\vec{m}=\vec{r}\times\vec{F}$
- Once we've got that, we can find the projection of $\vec{m}$ onto Axis of Interest, which is $m_{axis}=\vec{m}\cdot\vec{u}_{axis}=$scalar
- Combine these steps into the "Triple Scalar Product" $m_{axis}= (\vec{r}\times\vec{F})\cdot\vec{u}_{axis}$
#### example vibes
![[Statics 8.3]]
- So we're using this same general pipe assembly vibe
	- Except there's going to be a new pipe segment from the middle of the bottom (segment AB, except I didn't label it), and the new point F is going to be out at (2,-1,5) <sub>(I'm feeling lazy and don't want to draw</sub>
- Find the moment vector from $\vec{m}_{EF}$ from $\vec{F}_{D}$ 
	- So our position vector $\vec{r}$ can be any point on the axis of interest
	- We only have one force
	- and we want the axis of interest
	- soooo $m_{EF}=(\vec{r}_{ED}\times\vec{F}_{D})\cdot u_{EF}$
		- $\vec{r}_{ED}=(2,3,-4)-(1,0,0)=<1,3,-4>$
		- $\vec{u}_{EF}=<0.192,-0.192,0.962>$
$$m_{EF} = \begin{matrix}0.192 & -0.192 & 0.962 \\ 1 & 3  & 4 \\ 10 & 8 & -4\end{matrix}=  - 10.4 \text{ ft-lb}$$
- Which is negative because it'll be the opposite of the unit vector we used
- So then when you multiply through by $\vec{u}_{EF}$, you end up with $-2\hat{\imath}+2\hat{\jmath}-10\hat{k}$ ft-lb as your final answer
