## Cables Subject to Distributed Loads
- Lowest point has the least tension

- Origin of x-y goes at lowest point where slope $=0$
- When supports are at the same elevation, origin is halfway between
## FBD of CD

$$
\sum M_{D}=0  \ CCW
$$
$$
wx\left( \frac{x}{2} \right)-T_{0}*y=0
$$
$$
y=\frac{wx^{2}}{2T_{0}}
$$
- And that's the actual slope/shape of the cable.
$$
T_{o}=\frac{wx^{2}}{2y}
$$
- We're going to "use a force triangle," whatever the hell that means
	- Force triangle implements $\sum F_{x}$ and $\sum F_{y}$ simultaneously.

$$
T[x]=\sqrt{ T_{o}^{2}+(wx)^{2} }
$$
$$
\theta[x]=\tan ^{-1}\left( \frac{wx}{T_{0}} \right)
$$
### Fun aside, there are only really three other relevant possible FBDs
- The FBD of the entire damn system (I don't want to draw these because *I'm lazy*)
	- we can use $\sum F_{x},\sum F_{y},\sum M$, only problem is that's three equations and we have four unknowns
- FBDs to the left and right of the low point
	- They'd both have a $T_{o}$ like we just drew
	- Problem is we don't know $x_{A}$ or $x_{B}$ to either side, but we do know we have resultant forces from our distributed loads
	- We still have $\sum F_{x},\sum F_{y},\sum M$, but also not a convenient three unknowns.
## Example

![[CEEN241 - 2025-04-02 2025-04-02 10.35.28.excalidraw]]
- We want to find $T_{o},T_{max}$
- We have two options: Do this with some FBD shenanigans, or just jump straight into the neat equations we derived
$$
y=\frac{wx^{2}}{2T_{o}}
$$
- We don't know much, but we can figure out where the low point is going to be.
$$
y_{A}=\frac{wx_{A}^{2}}{2T_{0}}
$$
$$
y_{B}=\frac{wx_{B}^{2}}{2T_{0}}
$$
$$
w=100, y_{A}=40,y_{B}=20
$$
- This makes our unknowns $x_{A,}x_{B},T_{0}$
	- That looks like two equations and three unknowns. Great news: $x_{A}+x_{B}=L=40$
- To go about solving this thing, why not smack em together
$$
\frac{40=\frac{100x_{A}^{2}}{2T_{0}}}{20=\frac{100x_{B}^{2}}{2T_{0}}} = 2=\frac{x_{A}^{2}}{x_{B}^{2}}
$$
$$
x_{B}=40-x_{A}
$$
$$
2=\frac{x_{A}^{2}}{(40-x_{A})^{2}}
$$
$$
2(40-x_{A})^{2}-x_{A}^{2}=0
$$
$$
x_{A}=136.5ft \text{ or } 23.43ft
$$
- 136.5 is what we in the business call out of bounds, so $x_{A}=23.43$ feet, meaning that $x_{B}=16.57$ feet
$$
T_{o}=\frac{wx_{A}^{2}}{2y_{A}}= \frac{100*(23.43)^{2}}{80}=686.08\text{ lb}
$$
- If we go out to solve for $T_{max}$, it's going to be at $A$ since that has the steepest slope
$$
T[x]=\sqrt{ T_{o}^{2}+(wx)^{2} }
$$
$$
T[23.43]=\sqrt{ 686.08^{2} +(100(23.43))^{2}}=T_{max}=T_{A}=2440\text{ lb}
$$
