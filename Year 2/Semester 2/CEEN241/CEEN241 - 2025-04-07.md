## Get Friction-y with it (I totally didn't miss friction day 1)

- Friction goes opposite the direction of impending motion, as you would expect

$$
T_{1}=T_{2}e^{\mu \beta}
$$
- In this case, $e=2.718$, Euler's Number
- $\mu=$ coefficient of friction, as we'd expect
- $\beta=$ angle of contact in radians (gross)
- If we're given $\theta$ in terms of relative to $t_{2}$ to a vertical, $\beta=180-\theta$ to the horizontal because it swaps around
	- again, $\beta$ is in RADIANS. it normally just makes sense to work in degrees then swap over, but still.
- If you have an applied couple moment, impending motion is always to the opposite.
	- Okie, so we're looking at it and we have $T_{1}=T_{2}e^{\mu \beta}$
	- $\sum m_{o}=T_{1}*r-T_{2}*r-m=0$

##### Class example
![[CEEN241 - 2025-04-07 2025-04-07 10.33.32.excalidraw]]
- For our solution, let's start by looking at point C
![[CEEN241 - 2025-04-07 2025-04-07 10.36.49.excalidraw]]
- Because of the impending motion being down the ramp, $T_{B}>T_{A}, T_{B}=T_{A}e^{\mu \beta}$
![[CEEN241 - 2025-04-07 2025-04-07 10.44.22.excalidraw]]
- Weight in the $y$ direction is $W_{A}\cos(30)$, and weight in the $x$ is $W_{A}\sin(30)$

$$
\sum F_{x}=-W_{A}\sin(30)+T_{A}+\mu_{A}N_{A}=0
$$
$$
\sum F_{y}=-w_{A}\cos(30)+N_{A}=0
$$
- You also draw an FBD of $B$, but I kinda don't wanna, so the equations that pop out are
- $F_{FB}=\mu_{B}N_{B}$
$$
\sum F_{x}=-w_{B}\sin_{3}0+\mu_{A}N_{A}+\mu_{B}N_{B}+T_{B}=0
$$
$$
\sum F_{y}=-N_{A}-w_{B}\cos(30)+N_{B}=0
$$
