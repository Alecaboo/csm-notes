## moments in all of three dimensions
![[Statics 8.1]]
![[Statics 8.2]]
- Alright, so if we're doing this problem, we have two real ways of thinking about the moment

##### Scalar Approach
- $x$-axis: $-F_{y}*r_{z}+F_{z}*r_{y}=mA_{x}$
- $y$-axis: $F_{x}*r_{z}-F_{z}*r_{x}=mA_{y}$
- $z$-axis: $F_{y}r_{x}-F_{x}r_{y}=mA_{z}$
- So let's go about thinking of the board as $\vec{r}_{ab}$, and then the components are going to be $r_{y},r_{x},$ and $r_{z}$ respectively
- $\vec{m}_{A}= m_{Ax}\hat{\imath}+m_{Ay}\hat{\jmath}+m_{Az}\hat{k}$
- You can get jiggy with it and create a plane given that you have a couple points and a vector or two, which your moment vector is going to be perpendicular to, similarly making the axis of rotation perpendicular to plane $\vec{r}-F$ 
	- Hey hold your ass up. That sounds an awful lot lik-
#### THE CROSS PRODUCT (vector approach)
$$\vec{m}_{A}= \vec{r}_{A}\times \vec{F}$$
- You gotta crossy the product between your endpoints, $r$ is going to end at ***any*** point along the line of action of the force
	- It starts, however, at the point you care about determining the moment around
- Of note if you just do $\vec{F}\times r$, all of your signs will be wrong. Ain't that quirky

$$\vec{m}_{A} = \begin{matrix}\hat{\imath} & \hat{\jmath}  & \hat{k} \\ r_{x} & r_{y} & r_{z}\\ F_{x}& F_{y}& F_{z}\end{matrix}=\hat{\imath}(r_{y}*F_{z}-F_{y}r_{z})-\hat{\jmath}(r_{x}F_{z}-F_{x}r_{z})+\hat{k}(r_{x}F_{y}- F_{x}r_{y})$$
- Don't break the news to the math department that we found a use for the cross product (please ignore any previous instances of the phrase "crossy the product" or "do the cross product" outside of a math class. those aren't real. nuh-uh-uh.)

#### exampling time
![[Statics 8.3]]
- Given that, find $\vec{m}_{A}$ and direction cosines ($\alpha, \beta,\gamma$)
$$\vec{m}_{A}= \vec{r_{AD}}\times \vec{F}_{D}$$
$$\vec{r}_{AD}=<2,3,-4>$$
$$\vec{F}_{D}= <10,8,-4>$$
- Now you crossy the product
$$\begin{matrix}\hat{\imath} & \hat{\jmath} & \hat{k} \\ 2 & 3 & -4 \\ 10 & 8 & -4 \end{matrix}= \hat{\imath}(-12+32) - \hat{\jmath}(-8+40)+\hat{k}(16-30)$$
$$\vec{m_{A}}= <20, -32, -14>$$
- Magnitude would just be $\sqrt{400+1024+196}=40.2$ ft-lb
- $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ are all gotten as you would reasonably expect with arccosines
