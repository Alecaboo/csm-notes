##  Hydrostatic Fluid Pressure
- Pressure is based on the "unit weight" of water, $\gamma$
- For water, $\gamma=62.4 \ \frac{lb}{ft^{3}}$
	- A $1'\times 1' \times 1'$ cube of water weighs 62.4 lb
		- Somewhere my brain knew that. D&D probably?
	- In SI units, base is kg
		- We start with a unit density of $\rho=1000 \ \frac{kg}{m^3}$
			- You can make that into a unit weight, which would just be $\rho*g$, or $9.81 \ \frac{kN}{m^{3}}$
- How can we calculate the pressure at any given depth?
	- Hydrostatic fluid pressure is entirely based on how deep you are in the water
		- So let's say we're some $h_{A}$ feet down, maybe, 10ft.
		- $P_{A}=\gamma*h_{A}=62.4 \ \frac{lb}{ft^{3}}*10ft=624 \frac{lb}{ft^{2}}$
			- For reference, that's about 4.33 PSI, which is a noticeably more reasonable sounding measurement.
	- If we were to work in SI
		- $h_{A}=3.05m$
		- $P_{A}=\rho*\gamma*h_{A}=1000*9.81*3.05=29.92 \frac{kN}{m^{2}}$
### Normal Forces
- Hydrostatic fluid pressure is always normal to a surface
#### Pressure Distribution on a Vertical Wall
- We have some wall of a pool
	- Let's call $h=10$ft for the pool
	- We end up with some triangular pressure distribution
		- Said force acts normal to the wall 
		- Pressure at the bottom of the pool, $A$, is going to be $\gamma*h_{A}$
			- In this case, $p_{A}$ is going to be $624$ lb/ft^2
			- Now you just make it into a distributed load, $w=\text{Area of }p$
				- $w=\frac{1}{2 } p_{A}*h_{A}=3120 \frac{lb}{ft}$
	- $F_{R}=3120 \frac{lb}{ft}*(75)=234,000$ lb
### Example 9.14 from the textbook
![[Statics 9.14]]
- We want to find total hydrostatic force on the gate, which I drew in blue, $AB$
	- $p_{A}=\rho*g*2=19.62 \frac{kN}{m^{2}}$
	- $p_{B}=\rho*g*5m=49050 \frac{kN}{m^{2}}$
	- Now find the area of the p distribution
		- $w_{R}=\left( 3m*19.62 \frac{kN}{m^{2}} \right)$ and acts at 1.5m off the bottom of the gate
			- $w_{R}=58.86 \frac{kN}{m}$
		- $w_{T}=(1.5*(p_{B}-p_{A}))=44.145 \ \frac{kN}{m}$ acting at 1m off the bottom of the gate
	- Third and final thing to find is the total force
		- $F_{1}=1.5*58.86=88.29 kN$
		- $F_{2}=1.5*w_{T}=66.22 kN$
		- $\boxed{F_{total}=154.51 kNB}$
