# Internal Force Adventure
- Find the internal forces when you cut things, draw an FBD, other such fun adventures
![[Drawing 2025-03-24 10.06.39.excalidraw]]
- Some beam under tension would spread apart, beam under compression would squish together
- So if you had some concrete beam, where'd you stick the rebar?
	- I voted for the top, let's see how it goes
		- That was wrong. The bottom is under tension
![[CEEN241 - 2025-03-24 2025-03-24 10.11.32.excalidraw]]
- This is referred to as a bending moment, with compression on one side and tension on the other

- New question: What is exposed at a cut?
-![[CEEN241 - 2025-03-24 2025-03-24 10.15.42.excalidraw]]
- If we're looking for internal forces at that point, we're going to have to do an FBD on both sides of the cut

### Sign convention for internal forces
- N is the normal force (perp to cut) and is positive in tension
- V is the shear force which is positive
	- Shear force is positive when it rotates the object clockwise
- M, the bending moment is positive when in tension on bottom and compression on top
	- Gotta "pull" on the bottom and "push" on top

## Moving In to an Example
![[CEEN241 - 2025-03-24 2025-03-24 10.33.13.excalidraw]]
- Looking for internal forces at D and in BC
- Solution:
	- Going to need an FBD of AB to find support reactions
![[CEEN241 - 2025-03-24 2025-03-24 10.36.54.excalidraw]]$$
\sum M_{A}=0, F_{BC}=44.4kN
$$
$$
\sum F_{x}=0,A_{x}=35.5kN
$$
$$
\sum F_{y}=0,A_{y}=13.3kN
$$
![[CEEN241 - 2025-03-24 2025-03-24 10.40.55.excalidraw]]
$$
\sum F_{x}=0, 35.5+N_{D}=0,N_{D}=-35.5kN
$$
- Combined loading is where you combine all the compression loads, and that's a mechanics problem
$$
\sum F_{y}=0, \ \ 13.3-10-V_{D}=0, V_{D}=3.3kN
$$
$$
M_{D}+10kN\left( \frac{1}{3}(4) \right)-13.3(4)=0, \ \ m_{D}=40kN-m
$$
- For the internal forces in BC, a cut would be perpendicular to the member, a force coming from the other beam of 44.4 kN, perpendicular, and N acting along it
