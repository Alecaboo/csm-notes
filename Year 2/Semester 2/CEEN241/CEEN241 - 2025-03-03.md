continuing work with our yardstick truss from [[CEEN241 - 2025-02-28]]
## Zero Force Members
- Draw an FBD at a joint that meets the following criteria
	1. Only two members meet at a joint
	2. (or) Three members meet and two are colinear
- Why do we have zero force members?
	- Different loading conditions (ie, it's zero force *in this case*)
	- Overall stability so it doesn't get all wiggly wonkly
- Sooooo, back to our example
![[Statics First Truss Diagram]]
- Alright, so our conditions give us two possibilities
Where only two meet, in which case we're looking at D & E
- D is out for sure.
- At E, on the other hand

$$
\sum F_{y}=0
$$
$$
AE\sin(45)=0,AE=0
$$
$$
\sum F_{x}=0
$$
$$
AE\cos_{4}5+EF=0,EF=0
$$
- Oh hey, they're both zero, we've searched and destroyed. Now $F$ is a member that only has two, ain't that neat
![[CEEN241 - 2025-03-03 2025-03-03 10.18.27.excalidraw]]
- That sure looks like $FG$ is going to have to be zero.
![[CEEN241 - 2025-03-03 2025-03-03 10.20.07.excalidraw]]
$$
\sum F_{y}=0=BG
$$
- Oh boy, another zero force, get that shit *OUTTA HERE!*
- One FBD will never contradict another FBD

# There's really two ways of doing trusses
- We just covered method of joints
- And now we're doing
## Method of Sections
   ![[Statics Method of Sections first cut]]
   $$
\sum F_{y}=0, -BG\sin(56.31)-600=0, BG=-721.1N
$$
$$
\sum M_{B}=0=HG(3)-600(4), HG=800
$$
$$
\sum F_{x}=0 = -HG-BG\cos 56.31 -BC=0
$$
$$
-800-(-721.1)\cos_{5}6.31-BC=0, BC=-400N
$$
