The force $P$ is applied to the pancels of the pliers. Take that $P = 110N$
**Determine the clamping force exerted on the smooth pipe B**
$\circlearrowleft_{+_{CCW}}\sum M_{A} = 0$:
- $110N(250mm)-N_{B}(50mm) =0$
	- $N_{B}= \frac{27500N * mm}{50mm}=550N$

**Determine the magnitude of the resultant force that one of the members exerts on pin A.**
$\rightarrow_{+_{R}}\sum F_{x} = 0$:
- $(550N)\sin(45)-A_{x}=0$
	- $A_{x} = (550N)\sin(45) = 388.91N$
$\uparrow_{+}\sum F_{y}=0$:
- $A_{y}-110N-(550N)\cos(45)=0$
	- $A_{y} = 110N + (550N)\cos(45) = 498.91N$
$F_{A}=\sqrt{(388.91)^{2}+(498.91)^{2}} = 632.52N$

**Determine the magnitude of the force P required to hold the 90.0-lb weight in equilibrium.**

Ima lable the ropes going to the top 1-3.
Rope 1 has 45lb of weight its holding because its half of 90. Leaving 45 left.
Then 2 has 22.5, leaving another 22.5
Then 3 has 11.25, leaving 11.25 left.
Ending rope P is 11.25 because its the other side of C $\checkmark$

The shovel load has a mass of $1.85 Mg$ and a center of gravity at $G$. All joints are pin connected. Use the fact that $EF$ is perpendicular to $FH$.
**Determine the magnitude of the force created in the hydraulic cylinder EF in order to hold the shovel in equilibrium.**
<u>EF is a 2 force member</u>
$G_{x}=F_{WG} = 1850kg * 9.81 = 18148.5N$
$\circlearrowleft_{+_{CCW}}\sum M_{H}=0$:
- $-G_{x}(0.5m) + F_{EF}(d) =0$
	- $d = 1.5m*\sin(30) =0.75m$
- $F_{EF} = \frac{(18148.5N)(0.5m)}{0.75m} =12099N$

**Determine the magnitude of the force created in the hydraulic cylinder AD in order to hold the shovel in equilibrium.**
<u>AD is a 2 force member</u>
$\circlearrowleft_{+_{CCW}}\sum M_{C}=0$
- $F_{AD}\sin(60)*(0.25*\cos(10)) - F_{AD}\cos(60)*(0.25\sin(10))-G_{x}(d)$
- $F_{AD}(0.25m)(\sin(60)*(\cos(10)) -\cos(60)*(\sin(10)))-G_{x}(d)=0$
- $F_{AD} = \frac{G_{x}(d)}{(0.25m)(\sin(60)*(\cos(10)) -\cos(60)*(\sin(10)))}$
	- $\sin(60)*(\cos(10)) -\cos(60)*(\sin(10)) =0.7660$
	- $d= (.25m + .25m +1.5m)\cos(10) +.5 = 2.470m$
- $F_{AD} = \frac{(18148.5N)(2.470m)}{(.25)0.7660}=234068.90N$
