- I was starting to do work but it's literally just 400 - - 175 and that's the only one with 575
	- One of the sillier parts of statics is watching everyone move over to the correct answer

### particle equilibrium example
- I believe the only other people who say "free that body from the rest of the world" are drug dealers

- wait i did math wrong hang on (maybe)
	- yeah I forgot how triangles work but I did have the right vibe
- "Cables are all pulling forces *right now*"
	- Right now? The fuck do you push with a cable? What?

### ok work adventure for realsies
- crate adventure thing or whatever
$$A = <0,0,0>$$
$$B = < -2, 1, 2>$$
$$C = < -2, -2, 1>$$
$$D = < 3,0,0>$$
![[Statics 6.2]]
- Find the maximum $W$ so that no cable exceeds 450 lb of tension
![[Statics 6.3]]
- Strictly speaking you can write a vector as its magnitude times a unit vector ( I answered the sum of the squares because that's like relevant kinda for AD balancing with the rest but w/e)
$$|B| = 3, |C| = 3, |D| = 3$$
$$B_{u}= < -\frac{2}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3}> $$
$$C_{u}= <- \frac{2}{3}, - \frac{2}{3}, \frac{1}{3}>$$
$$D_{u}= <1,0,0>$$
$$\vec{F}_{AB}=F_{AB}B_{u}$$
.... yadayadayada.

- See, here's Chekov's Components I was talking about.
$$\sum\limits F_{x}= 0 = - \frac{2}{3}F_{AB} -  \frac{2}{3}F_{Ac} + F_{AD} $$
$$\sum\limits F_{y}= 0 = \frac{1}{3}F_{AB} - \frac{2}{3}F_{AC}  $$
$$\sum\limits F_{z}=0 = \frac{2}{3}F_{AB}+ \frac{1}{3}F_{AC} - w$$
- ok now we go on an algebra expedition (or just guess)
	- Given that $B_{u}$ has the steepest $z$ component, we're going to assume that's our limiting 
		- (I haven't written that phrase since chem 1)
$$\frac{1}{3}(450) = \frac{2}{3}F_{AC}$$ $$F_{AC}= 225$$ $$ \frac{2}{3}(450) + \frac{2}{3}(225) = F_{AD} = 450$$$$\frac{2}{3}(450) + \frac{1}{3}(225) = W= 375\text{ lb}$$
