Problem 6.100
![[Pasted image 20250325003946.png]]
$P = 60lb$. The pin at $C$ is attached to member $ABCD$ and passes through the smooth slot in member $ECF$.
**Determine the horizontal and vertical components of force that the pin A exerts on member ABCD.**
<u>Forces on point F:</u>
$F_{x}=-60lb* 32.174 = -1930.44f*lb$
- $D_{x}=1930.44f*lb$
$F_{y} = 60lb* 32.174 = 1930.44f*lb$

$\circlearrowleft_{+_{CCW}}\sum M_{A}=0$:
- $-F_{BE}(3ft)+D_{x}(10ft)+60lb(1ft)$
- $F_{BE}=\frac{D_{x}(10ft)+60lb(1ft)}{3ft}$
- $F_{BE}=\frac{(60)(10ft)+60lb(1ft)}{3ft}$
- $F_{BE}=220lb$

$A_{x} =220-60=160lb$




**Determine the horizontal and vertical components of force that the pin B exerts on member ABCD**


**Determine the horizontal and vertical components of force that the pin C exerts on member ABCD**

he double link grip is used to lift the beam. The beam weighs $2 kN$. Assume $B$ and $F$ are pins. Take $EC = 320mm$

**Determine the horizontal and vertical components of force acting on the pin at A.**
<u>First finding E and C components:</u>
$DE = DC$
This also means:
$E_{x} = E_{y} = C_{x}=C_{y} = \frac{P_{y}}{2}=1000N$


<u>Left side of hook from C to F:</u>
$\circlearrowleft_{+_{CCW}}\sum M_{F}=0$:
- $-A_{y}(.28m) +A_{x}(.28m) + C_{x}(.4m)+C_{y}(.44m)$
- $-A_{y}(.28m) +A_{x}(.28m) + (1000N)(.4m)+(1000N)(.44m)$
- $0.28m(-A_{y}+A_{x})+840N*m=0$
- $-A_{y}+A_{x}= -3000N$

<u>Right side of hook from E to B:</u>
$\circlearrowleft_{+_{CCW}}\sum M_{B}=0$:
- $-A_{y}(.28m) -A_{x}(.28m) + E_{x}(.4m)-E_{y}(.44m) =0$
- $-A_{y}(.28m) -A_{x}(.28m) - (1000N)(.4m)-(1000N)(.44m) =0$
- $-0.28(A_{y}+A_{x})-840N*m=0$
- $A_{y}+A_{x}= -3000N$
<u>Solve for the components:</u>
$-A_{y}+A_{x}= -3000N$
$A_{y}+A_{x}= -3000N$
$A_{y} = 0$
$A_{x}=-3000N = -3kN$

**Determine the horizontal and vertical components of force that the flange of the beam exerts on the grip at B.**
<u>Right side of hook from E to B:</u>
$\sum F_{x}=0$:
- $-E_{x} -A_{x}+B_{x}=0$
- $B_{x}=A_{x}+E_{x}= (3000N)-1000N = 2000N = 2kN$
$\sum F_{y}=0$:
- $-E_{y} +A_{y}-B_{y}=0$
- $-B_{y} = E_{y} + A_{y}$
- $B_{y}=-(1000N)-(0N) = -1000N = -1kN$

#### Question 3:
Problem 6.114
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ9BX0ngH4I
The platform scale consists of a combination of third and first class levers so that the load on one lever becomes the effort that moves the next lever. Through this arrangement, a small weight can balance a massive object.
![[Pasted image 20250325004229.png]]
If $x=450 mm$ and the mass of the counterweight $S$ is $m = 2.0kg$:
**Determine the mass of the load L required to maintain the balance**

<u>Along the main line:</u>
$\circlearrowleft_{+_{CCW}}\sum M_{C}=0$:
- $F_{ED}*(0.1m) -2_{kg}*9.81*(.950m)=0$
	- $F_{ED}= \frac{2*9.81*(.950m)}{(0.1m)}=186.39N$

<u>Cut just below EG:</u>
$\circlearrowleft_{+_{CCW}}\sum M_{F}=0$:
- $F_{ED}*(.25m)-F_{BG}*(.15m)=0$
- $F_{BG}= \frac{F_{ED}*(.25m)}{.15m}$
- $F_{BG}= \frac{(186.39)*(.25m)}{.15m} = 310.65N$

<u>Cut below main line:</u>
$\circlearrowleft_{+_{CCW}}\sum M_{A}=0$:
- $(.5m)F_{BG}-(.15m)m_{L}*g=0$
- $m_{L} = \frac{(.5m)F_{BG}}{(.15m)g}$
- $m_{L} = \frac{(.5m)(310.65N)}{(.15m)(9.81)}=105.56kg$ $\checkmark$
