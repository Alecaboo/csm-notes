## Some housekeeping stuff
- Make a zip file for your submission. Don't fuck it up. etc etc.

### Actual Note Things
- If you have two integers you want to divide and want to get a double back, just cast em' up to a double so you get a double.
- You can go unsigned to get an extra bit worth, if you don't care if something is positive or negative
	- Of note, setting an unsigned integer to -1 will give you a really big number, because of how two's complement works 
- The whole "seven digits of precision" on floats doesn't care about the 0's, because of that whole mantissa bit
- If you wanted to only compile, you'd say `g++ -o main.o -c main.cpp`
	- If you wanted to only link, you'd say `g++ -o a.out main.o`
	- Using the standard `g++ main.cpp` does both at the same time
- We use Mersenne Twister to generate random numbers
	- we use 
```cpp
#include <random> using namespace std;
random_device rd;
mt19937 mt( rd());
```

- Random device is for the seed
- We choose distribution (`uniform_int_distribution<int> intDist(min,max);`) or real
- and from there you can go `randomNum = intDist(mt)` or `floatDist` if you used `uniform_real_distrubtion<float>` 

### Makefiles
- Running the `make` command looks in the current directory for a makefile, then runs it
- Makefiles have a fancy bit of stuff you can do, but we'll do with that
