## FUN with FUNctions
- ok, it's bad, I know
- Functions are essentially the fun part of shoving all your problems into a box and you just feed in wheat and get pasta out.
	- Neat part: they're reusable, DRY - don't repeat yourself
		- alternatively, WORM (Write Once Read Many)
	- Also, Single Responsibility Principle - a function should do *one* thing.
	- Functions are also neat and modular, and you can just lob them around
#### there are really three ways to declare functions
- Simple, basic way is just declaring them above `main()` in the same `main.cpp`
- You can also lob them into external files, but that's a boat we'll float in about a week
- Functions have a name, the parameters they take in, and the data type they return
- You can either document your functions aggressively with a brief, a description of each parameter, and then info on the return, or use Doxygen to fill it in for you

#### other fun bits
- Arguments are what you pass in when you call a function, which are parameters when you're setting up a function
	- Arguments are actual, parameters are the made up things you deal with when setting up function
- Primitives are passed by value as a copy
-
