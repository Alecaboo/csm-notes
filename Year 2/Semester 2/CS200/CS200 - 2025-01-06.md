### Housekeeping
- Professor (not Dr) Scholten, Clark is just fine (skol-ten)
	- The rest of the professors have a doctorate, he just has twenty-six years of industry experience
- This class is half computer science majors. How horrifying.
- Late policy on a lab is 15%, for assignments you lose 0.5 out of 6 points, so like, 8% of it if you nail the rest of it.
	- Once grades are returned, you can turn something back in to get half of deducted points back (ie, you got a 5/6, you can get 0.5 points back. You get a 0/6, you can get 3 points back.)
### differences between python and c++
- Python is interpreted, c++ is compiled
- Python is dynamically typed, c++ is statically typed
- Garbage Collection vs Memory Allocation
	- You have to manage your memory in c++, so while in python you don't have to clean up memory, needing to manage your own memory is quite powerful (if you do the work.)
- Whitespace does/doesn't matter
	- c++ trades whitespaces for needing to worry about semicolons.
