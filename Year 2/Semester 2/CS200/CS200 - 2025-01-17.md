## Quick bitwise operator aside
- `~ & | ^ ` are all bitwise operators, you want to be efficient, check bit by bit, etc, etc. We don't really need them a whole lot (or really at all) in this class, but they do exist
	- NOT AND OR XOR, respectively.

# Loops!
- When setting up (for) loops in C++, there's three questions
	1. What is the initial value?
	2. What condition must be met for the sequence to execute?
	3. How is the parameter modified as you go?
		1. Generally stepping, but like, whatever.
- Three general kinds of loops
	- `while` loops, which are great when you don't know how many times you want to loop
	- `for` loops, which are great for when you know exactly how many times you want to loop
	- `do-while`, which is a bottom controlled loop, so you go at least once and could go more times
- Don't fencepost yourself.
- Prefix and postfix do matter for `++` and `--` operators, prefix happens first. Crazy how that works.
	- ie, `y=x++` would first set `y` to `x`, then add one to `x` ( leaving `x=6` and `y=5`)

- x is going to be 11, y is going to be 8
- a is also going to be 11, b is going 7

### Scope
- Global exists everywhere in all code blocks
- Local exists only the single code block you declare it in
- You generally want to make constants global (and name them accordingly), but most variables should almost certainly be local.
