# Functions. They're fun and ction. 
- This was just talking about functions in the abstract, so I was waaaay too lazy to bother writing notes down. Read some wonderful John Bierce short stories instead.
- Note: I deeply apologize if you're reading these particular notes with the intention of learning something. I, unfortunately, already know what I'm doing, so my notes are reaaaally shit. Godspeed, soldier.
