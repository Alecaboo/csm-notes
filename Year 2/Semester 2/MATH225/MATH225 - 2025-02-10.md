## Quick continuation of example from [[MATH225 - 2025-02-07]]
$$\frac{dB}{dt}+ 0.3B = 6-4.5e^{-0.3}$$
- Which we had solved with an integrating factor and had a jolly ol' time
- However, MUC is also perfectly legal here
$$B_{c}= c_{1}e^{-0.3t}$$
- Super easy peasy, job done

$$B_{p}=C+De^{-0.3t}$$
- Is our guess here, where the $C$ is basically a 0th order polynomial
- Minor wicket: $e^{-0.3t}$ already occurs in our homogeneous solution, so we're going to have to get funky.

$$B_{p}= C+Dte^{-0.3t}$$
-
