## Engine Time
- Bore is the diameter of the cylinder
- TDC (Top Dead Center) is the highest it can go, BDC is Bottom Dead Center and the lwoest it geos
	- Stroke is the distance between them
- Displacement volume is the cylinder of bore by stroke
$$
\underbrace{ r }_{ \text{Compression ratio} }= \frac{V\llap{-}_{BDC}}{V\llap{-}{TDC}} = \frac{V\llap{-}_{d}+V\llap{-}_{c}}{V\llap{-}_{c}} = 1 + \frac{V\llap{-}_{d}}{V\llap{-}_{c}}
$$
- Real is an open system, with fuel + air
- us is a closed system, where air is an ideal system

- Dealing with a four stroke, or four state kind of deal
	- Intake is State 1, we've schoomped the air in
	- Compress the everloving shit out of it is state 2
	- Get caboom
	- Reset

- Referred to as the Otto Cycle, after the guy who invented spark ignition engines 
	- Exam 2 will have either Otto or Diesel, not both
- Because it's closed, we're using $c_{v}\Delta t$

- Quick equation cheat sheet maybe
$$
r = \frac{V\llap{-}_{BDC}}{V\llap{-}_{TDC}}=\frac{V\llap{-}_{1}}{V\llap{-}_{2}} = \frac{V\llap{-}_{4}}{V\llap{-}_{3}}\to \frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}}=\frac{T_{3}}{T_{4}}= r^{k-1}; \to \frac{T_{4}}{T_{1}}=\frac{T_{3}}{T_{2}}
$$
$$
\eta_{\text{th,otto}}= \frac{W_{net}}{Q_{in}}= \frac{Q_{in}-Q_{out}}{Q_{in}}=1-\frac{Q_{out}}{Q_{in}}=1-\frac{mc_{v}(T_{4}-T_{1})}{mc_{v}(T_{3}-T_{2})}= 1-\frac{(T_{4}-T_{1})}{(T_{3}-T_{2})} = 1-\frac{1}{r^{k-1}}
$$

- For air, k=1.4, R = .287, $c_{v}$ is 0.717
- Max temperature and pressure is state 3. It's a bomb. :FasBomb:

-------------

## Oooookie dokies wtf does this actually look like in a problem
- At the beginning of compression, $r=9$, this is state 1 type information. We never back calculate state 1
- Heat addition to the air is 1kJ
- Max temperature in the cycle is 750
- Hold on state 4 until the problem says to
- We're looking for net work, $W_{net}$, thermal efficiency, $\eta_{\text{th}}$, and MEP
	- If you have $r$ that's thermal efficency
	- MEP is Mean Effective Pressure in kPa
		- which is $\frac{W_{net}}{V\llap{-}d}$

| State 1            | State 2  | State 3         | State 4  |
| ------------------ | -------- | --------------- | -------- |
| $p_{1}=95$         |          | $T=750\degree$C |          |
| $t_{1}=30\degree$C | $T_{2s}$ |                 | $T_{4s}$ |
- Using k equations $s_{1}=s_{2}$, $s_{3}=s_{4}$
- So we're dealing with air, so k=1.4, $c_{v}=0.717$, R=0.287
- r is $\frac{v_{1}}{v_{2}}$
- We can only really get $W_{net}$ through like $Q_{in}-Q_{out}$ or dealing iwth all of our temps
$$
Q_{in}=mc_{v}(T_{3}-T_{2})
$$
- Mass is .005 kg
	- And we add 1kj to the air
	- $1=(0.005)(0.717)(T_{3}-T_{2})$
	- If we weren't given Q we would use k equations to solve for it
