			- Reheat/ideal/actual are all options for the other rankine
		- The Two Others

			- Could be:
				- Chapter 4, ie tanks, piston cylinders, other closed systems
				- Could also totally be chapter 6 (carnot/cop), chapters 7 & 8 with entropy, engines on chapter 10, etc
	- Happy Birthday, from one to three PM.
## Lots of Exam Review
- Know your open and closed, especially for rankine
	- Closed is per pipe for pressures, open system all has the same pressures
- What will you get provided on the exam?
	- We'll get the process diagram
		- So having the T-S diagram is awesome, because it tells you phase, pressure, etc
		- Equations, which is great for knowns/uknowns
	- On more complicated problems, we'll get the state table that drod so loves to draw every time
- *Please* pay attention to units, it tells you so much and is such a free way to not fuck it up.

# Quiz on Wednesday if you show up
