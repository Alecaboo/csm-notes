# Exam 1 Review and Housekeeping Things
- **REMEMBER YOUR CALCULATOR DUMBASS**
- Constants are given, if your lookup isn't exact you fucked up.
- Exam is Chapters 1-5, so anything about COP is chapter 6 and not the problem
- Also homeworks 1-4
	- Homework solutions are getting updated and such
- Short answer, quick lookup type shit
- There are only four problems!
	- That's fucking horrifying, for the record.
- Something something fear is the mind killer, just lock in
- Air is special and not a lookup, don't do air for a lookup problem, don't do lookups for an air problem
- Do your states!
- If someone walks out of the room, closes the door, and screams, I *will* laugh
- Fear might be the mind killer, but time is the grade killer


- I would bet money that homework 3 is number 3
