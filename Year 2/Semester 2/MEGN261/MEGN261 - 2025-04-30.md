### Entropy
$$
\Delta S = cp \ln \frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}}-R\ln \frac{p_{2}}{p_{1}}
$$
$$
\Delta = cv \ln \frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}}+ R\ln \frac{v_{2}}{v_{1}}
$$
- $cp$ is for open, $cv$ is for closed
	- This feels like a not so subtle exam hint.
- Water is lookups
- Sgen is $\frac{ds}{dt}=\dot{m}\Delta s + \frac{\dot{Q}}{Ts}+Sgen$

### Quick bit on Chapter 4 (Closed systems)
- That's internal energy

###### The fuckass house problem
- It has a $Qout$ of 50,000 kj/hr
- The inside temp needs to be $22$C for 10 hours
- It's heated by 50 glass containers that are each 20L at 80C
- There's an electric heater at 80 kw to pick up the slack
- Blah blah blah blah, blah blah, blah blah blah blah. I didn't really want to pay attention. Do the math, it'll be on the exam, probably, given that he bothered to talk about it. 
	- Easiest way to simplify this is to do units and just let those be your guiding light.
