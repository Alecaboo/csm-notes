	- Header
		- Have LinkedIn
	- Education
	- Projects
	- Work experience

- Ideally, lock up two internships so you can have job offers going into senior year
	- bare minimum one. you're deadass throwing with zero.
	- Once you willy wonka your golden ticket into one internship, it's really easy to get a second one
		- Shoot the good industries instead of fighting for your life in like biomed engineering or aero
	- Feel free to do a little white lie like toss EES on, since you'll be fluent by the time it matters for them
	- Lob activities/hobbies on the end if you have spare space
