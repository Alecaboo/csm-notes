Mines is cold in the winter, outside temperature of 0C (boundary temp for later), room is currently 10C and we want it to be 20C. Heated by an electric heater at 120V and 15A, the heater also has a fan of 150W to distribute hot air around the room. The room loses heat at 500W. The room has dimensions of 4x5x7. The air is an ideal gas, the room is sealed and all doors are closed, and room is empty. Starting pressure is 100 kPa

1. Is this a closed system? Why?
2. Derive the equation explictly for change in time
	$$
\Delta E (10C \to 20C) = (120*15)*\Delta t - 500*\Delta t - 150\Delta t
$$
$$
\Delta E(10C \to 20C) = \Delta t(1800 -500-150)
$$
$$
\Delta E(10C \to 20C) = \Delta t(1150)
$$
$$
\Delta t = \frac{\Delta E}{1150}
$$

3. Solve for how long it takes to heat the room
4. Solve for Sgen

- Early jet engines could be simplified to a brayton cycle, except input (density?) is 1/5 what standard conditions would be because of high altitude. etc for a brayton cycle with a peak temperature of 600?, input temperature of {some air temperature}, and volumetric flow rate of 1.2 m^3 /s, pressure ratio of 8
1. Find $\rho$ of the air (density, kg/m^3)
2. Find $\dot{m}$ of the air
3. Find wnet
4. Find Qin and BWR
