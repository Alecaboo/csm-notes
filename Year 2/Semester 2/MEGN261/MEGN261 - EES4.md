These graphs are completely consistent with what I would expect from a engine with a higher compression ratio - a larger compression ratio makes more power from the same input amount of energy, which is quite literally the definition of thermal efficiency, so it makes sense that that value goes up as well. A more compressed fluid has a higher pressure, so more energy from the inevitable kaboom that is how engines work.
