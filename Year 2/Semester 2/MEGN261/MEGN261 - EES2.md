# Plot Discussion
- These plots both make sense - output temperature being higher as output pressure is higher checks out with the Ideal Gas Law (even though we're not treating it as an ideal gas, the same principles of like, physics apply), and the power output decreasing as the output steam is more pressurized also makes sense because the higher the output pressure of steam, the less of a difference in entropy, and therefore the less power output. (It also just makes sense intuitively - the less of a change caused by the turbine, the less output from the turbine)
