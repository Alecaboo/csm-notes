## Fun with units
- Thermo (the class) just uses SI now 
	- They used to use imperial as well
		- If you work for the government (which,frankly, we probably are), you're going to have to use both
	- The United States is inconsistent as shit
	- Which units *do* we use and write things as?
		- Volume - $m^{3}$ - $\forall$ (it's really v with a bar, but I'm still figuring out typing that)
		- mass - kg - m
			- $\dot{m}$ is rate/time/sec. It's $\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{sec}}$, which is for mass transfer
		- If you slap a dot on top, that is (unit) of flow rate per second, so like $\dot{\forall}$ is the flow rate of some fluid in $m^{3}$/sec
			- Normal $V$ is velocity, but it does come up, sometimes. probably.
		- When you divide by mass $\frac{}{\text{mass}}$, we call that "specific"
			- ie, $\frac{\forall}{m}$ is specific volume, $m^{3}/kg$
			- Anything that's specific is written lowercase - the aforementioned specific volume is $v$
		- There are shenanigans with phase that I didn't write down
		- Pressure is Pascals, we use $kPa$ 
			- Bar and PSI also exist, as do PSI, especially PSI in lots of other things, but we use kPa, soooooooo, oh well
			- $P_{\text{absolute}}=P_{\text{atm}}+P_{\text{gauge}}$ 
				- There's something in the reading about a vacuum
		- Force is pressure times area 
			- SI is newtons, here we use kN 

![[Engine sketch shenanigans]]
- We're calling up positive, because, y'know what, feel like it
	- That one pointing up is up, down is down, yadayada, you can do some shenanigans with units. Pay attention to it
		- Power is represented by no less than three different symbols, because fuck you. $\dot{W}$, W, and w.
			- $\dot{W}=\frac{kJ}{s}-kW$ 
			- W is kJ
			- w is $\frac{kJ}{kg}$ 
			- That's rate, no rate, and specific. It does, annoyingly, follow the conventions and make reasonable sense.

#### I'm doing a whole new heading here.
Someone just said the phrase "specific mass." I feel this needs calling out.

#### ok back to main work
$$\frac{kJ}{kg}* \frac{kg}{s}\to \frac{kJ}{sec}$$
- Oh hey, $\frac{kg}{s}$ is $\dot{m}$. Ain't that neat.
- Back to specific volume, $v=\frac{m^{3}}{kg}$
	- Ain't it silly, but density is $\rho= \frac{kg}{m^{3}}$ 
	- Reportedly, the easiest equation we have is $v = \frac{\forall}{\text{mass}}$


- toDo: put this in a table

##### Let's say we're on the exam
- Other than, as they say, going through it, what can you do?
	- Do unit shenanigans.
- A 1L tank has 1kg of water, what is the specific volume? (in $\frac{m^{3}}{kg}$)
	- $\frac{1}{1000}$, because liters are some shenanigans
	-
