## EES3

![[ees3drawing]]
- Entropy generated for this system 
$$
\frac{ds}{dt}=m\Delta s + \frac{Q}{Tb}+S_{gen}
$$
- $\frac{ds}{dt}$ is going to be zero, Q is going to be zero (adiabatic), up to you if you want to code them or just drop em out. EES will handle it.
	- Do not use $c_{p}$ or $c_{v}$ in EES. The graders will literally kill you. 
$$
\dot{m}\Delta s = \dot{m}_{air}(s_{2}-s_{1})+\dot{m}_{water}(s_{2}-s_{1})
$$
```EES
s_1a = entropy(air, prop1, prop 2)
h_1a = enthalpy(air,T)
```
- Don't do the math yourself! Let EES do it for you. Be *lazy*. Be *free*.
$$
\eta_{c}=\frac{\text{ideal}}{\text{actual}}, \eta_{T}= \frac{\text{actual}}{\text{ideal}}
$$

## Big Picture Where the Class is going
- The entirety of the rest of the course is cycles, which is the application.
	- We're doing engines! Internal combustion, diesel, holly jolly.
	- We're going to deal with four states in engines, following the four stroke process.
- Following engines we get into the Brayton cycle, which is a turbo or a natural gas power plant.
	- Starts out at four states, goes to 6-8-10
- Last cycle we cover is the Rankine cycle, which is coal/nuclear power plant
- We dealin with complex systems up in here
	- Lots of focused on being prepared as we can possibly be for a job
	- Also, fuck you Boulder.

## Quick Jump Back to Literally Day 1
- I took no notes from this, but weird that it happened.
