## Housekeeping
- Project is assigned Wednesday, work in groups of two
	- Project is going to be modeling the campus power system with solar or some other shenanigans

## Anyways, back to Brayton
- We mean the ideal, basic bitch brayton cycle when we say Brayton ideal
	- We use ideal gas, we use constant specific heats, we use k-equations, it's a grand old time

- the shaft is a little floppy

### Actual Brayton

$$
\eta_{c}<1, \eta_{t}<1
$$
![[Drawing 2025-03-24 14.09.22.excalidraw]]
$$
\eta_{c}=\frac{ideal}{actual}= \overbrace{ \frac{h_{2}s-h_{1}}{h_{2}a-h_{1}} }^{ EES }=\frac{c_{p}(T_{2s}-T_{1})}{c_{p}(T_{2a}-T_{1})}
$$
- To review
	- $T_{1}$ is given
	- $c_{p}$ is given
	- $T_{2s}=T_{1}\left( \frac{P_{2}}{P_{1}} \right)^{k-1}$

$$
\eta_{T}=\frac{actual}{ideal}=\frac{h_{3}-h_{4a}}{h_{3}-h_{4s}}=\frac{T_{3}-T_{4a}}{T_{3}-T_{4s}}
$$

## Time for Mod(ifications)s
- Design Criteria are generally
	1. More power
	2. Meet current $\eta_{th}$ of the cycle or better
		- $\eta_{th}$ translates into money.
	3. Operation and maintenance
		- That's what we in the business call an outage
	- Cost \$\$\$\$\$\$\$ 

- We're currently lobbing some pretty toasty air out the other side of our gas turbine, which is waste heat, lost work, or exergy
	- We're just going to put another combustion chamber (heat exchanger, for us) after the waste heat to heat it back up to where we actually can use it.
- $$
w_{net}=W_{t_{1}}+W_{t_{2}}-W_{c}
$$
$$
\eta_{th}=\frac{W_{T_{1}}+W_{T_{2}}-W_{c_{2}}}{Q_{in_{1}}+Q_{in_{2}}}
$$
- Hey, if we need two combustion chambers, we almost certainly need more air, which is going to be achieved through multi-stage compression
- Regeneration puts some extra heat inbetween the compressor and the combustion chamber
$$
W_{c}=W_{ext}=\dot{m}(h_{2}-h_{1})
$$
