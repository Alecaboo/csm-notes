## Housekeeping
- Exam is next Tuesday!
- There are four questions. That is, in fact, still terrifying.
	1. Chapter 6 (exam 1 practice tpye shit) with any fluid
	2. Chapter 7/8, with any fluid
	3. Otto or diesel, with air
	4. Brayton cycle with air
	- No rankine! 
- We have two more quizzes that are going to smuggle themselves in before the end of semester, they're going to be in-class
- Boiler is $Q_{in}$
- Condenser is $Q_{out}$
- $\dot{w}_{net}=\dot{w}_{t}-\dot{w}_{p}$
- $\eta_{cycle}=\frac{\dot{w}_{net}}{Qin}$

#### Combined power plants are a thing that exists
- Which is Rankine + Brayton
	- Someone got the wise idea of putting the positives of both together, which, shockingly, works pretty well.
	- We're dumping the coal out of the Rankine
- Mods on Rankine are weird because we have lookups
	- Reheat, works the same as Brayton
	- Regen is going to be like a full week, but we have closed and open feedwater heaters
		- For both of those we have to take a bleed, because we're essentially the only source of power/heat, so we gotta rob it from somewhere.
