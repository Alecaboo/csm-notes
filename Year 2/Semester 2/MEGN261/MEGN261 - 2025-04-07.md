### Brayton Review
$\dot{Q}_{in}=\dot{m}c_{p}(T_{3}-T_{2})$
$\dot{W}_{c}=\dot{m}c_{p}(\Delta T)$
$w_{c}=c_{p}(\Delta T)$
- If Brayton (ideal) is on the exam, that should be the most comically free points of all time

- If we're given $\eta_{t}$ and $\eta_{c}$, we're going to find the actual temps
- If we're asked for efficiencies, we need to find our temps and make sure $\eta$ is less than 1. 

$$
\eta_{c} = \frac{ideal}{actual}= \frac{T_{2s}-T_{1}}{T_{2a}-t_{1}}
$$
$$
\eta_{t}=\frac{actual}{ideal}=\frac{T_{4a}-T_{3}}{T_{4s}-t_{3}}
$$
- Use actual on everything if you have actuals.
### Mods
- Reheat
	- Reheat is literally just two combustion chambers and two turbines.
		- $w_{net}=w_{t_{1}}+w_{t_{2}}-w_{c}$
		- $Q_{in}=Q_{in_{1}}+Q_{in_{2}}$
		- $\eta_{th}=\frac{w_{net/}}{Q_{in}}$
- Regen, we literally just have a hot pipe and a cold pipe thing
- Hot goes to the cold

$\text{Effectiveness}=\frac{Q_{regen}}{Q_{regen,max}}=\epsilon$
- $\epsilon$ is how much of the hot makes it to the cold
- If $\epsilon$ is given, we use our equation to figure out the temperature
- If we have to find it, then we need to determine our temperatures and more has to be given.

# Rankine is not on the exam, but it will be half of the final. Godspeed.
