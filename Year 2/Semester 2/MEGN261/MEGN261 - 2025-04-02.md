- 210MW steam power plant operates on a simple non-ideal Rankine cycle. Steam enters the turbine @ 10MPa and 500C and is cooled in the condenser at pressure = 5kPa. Assume $\eta_{T}=\eta_{P}=85\%$
	- Do recall that Rankine and Brayton actual are actually very similar
- Chapter 8 is legal on the exam, which means that effiencies are legal

$$
\eta_{T}=\frac{actual}{ideal}=\frac{h_{4}-h_{3}}{h_{4}-h_{3}}
$$
- if
	- $\eta_{th}$ is given, we use algebra to get an enthalpy
- else if
	- $\eta_{th}$ not given, then we need to track down all of the $h$ values and it's a fucking pain.
- They're both 0.85

$$
\dot{m}=\frac{wnet}{w_{T}=(h_{3}-h_{4a})}
$$
$$
c_{p}(T_{2a}-T_{1})
$$
