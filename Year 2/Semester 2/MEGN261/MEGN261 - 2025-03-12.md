### Housekeeping
- No class Friday
- No homework over break, stuff due tonight/tomorrow

$$
\frac{dh}{dt}=cp, \frac{du}{dt}=cv
$$
$$
dh\approx cpdt, du \approx cvdt
$$
$$
q_{23}=q_{in}=h_{3}-h_{2}
$$
- Do that instead of $c_{p}$ or $c_{v}$. If the grader sees cp cv you will be shot

$$
q_{out}=q_{41}=u_{4}-u_{1}
$$
- Vertical line, 
```
s1=s2
s3=s4
p2=p3
v1=v4
q_in=h3-h2
q_out= u4-u1
w_net = q_in - q_out
eta_th = w_net / q_in

Function calls (Air vs Air_ha)
	(air_ha is the more complex one, just use air)
Enthalpy/Internal energy for Air with 1 property

enthalpy(air)
intenergy(air)

temperature()
pressure()
volume()

r=v1/v2

# Brayton Cycle
- At the big end, this is the model for a natural gas power plant
	- At the little end, this is a turbocharger in a car
- Once we pop into the Rankine cycle, we'll deal with combined plants( that use both coal and natural gas)
- We look at cycles three ways, ideal, actual, and mods
- Ideal brayton is just air, which is on the same shaft as your turbine
- We model combustion q as the top heat exchanger, and 
$$
BWR= \frac{W_{c}}{W_{t}}
$$
- When we switch from ideal to actual, we assign isentropic efficiencies to the turbines and compressor
