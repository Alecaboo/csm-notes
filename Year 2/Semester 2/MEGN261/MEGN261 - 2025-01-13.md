## housekeeping
- by homework three, there is 1. no multiple choice 2. it fucking sucks
- also switching to wednesday to-dos, career day that moves to thursday, then back to wednesday

## further adventures in vocab

#### Quick recap
- $\dot{W}$ is power, kw, $\frac{kJ}{s}$
- W - kJ
- w is specific $\frac{kJ}{kg}$
- m - mass, kg
- $\dot{m}$, mass transfer, $kg/s$
- $\dot{\forall}$ volumetric flow rate
- $\forall$, volume
- V, velocity
- v, specific volume
	
#### Dealing with Systems
- We have some system, with some defined system boundary
- Energy
	- Work
		- Different forms of work (holy moly the handwriting on that one)
	- Heat Transfer, Q
		- Radiation, convection, conduction. Good news: here in thermo we only care about heat transfer across the system boundary.
			- Is heat leaving? Is it going in? We only care if it goes across the boundary
				- Otherwise, that's what we in the business call a violation of the first law of thermodynamics. You get a citation for creating (or destroying) energy.
				- Also, generally, cooling down (losing heat from the system) is negative, and adding energy in is positive. This means literally nothing except for the fact we feel like it should
			- This also applies for work
				- Also, fuck you. Work is backwards. It's just the opposite of heat transfer, but regardless, fuck you. Work done to the system is negative, work out, what's done by the system, is positive.
	- Example: Compressor in refrigerator
		- The compressor in there is work done to the system in moving refrigerant around
	- Generally, we talk about work done *by* the system, like the many, many kinds of turbines
- All kinds of other shit can also happy, but we don't care!
	- Chemical reactions are, like, objectively energy. Not our problem. We do work and heat transfer.
- If we say the system is "adiabatic", there's no heat transfer
	- That literally only comes up as a term in textbook, otherwise it's insulated

![[Open Closed Tank example]]
- Heat could be transferring through either of these! Energy has absolutely nothing to do with the mass, which is something I somewhat struggled to get through my head.
- There is a pump *somewhere*, but there's quite noticeably not any work happening in the system. 
- We've talked about conservation of energy, what can we talk about?
	- In the closed system, we can absolutely talk about heat transfer
		- work, $w=0$ 
		- $Q=\ ?$ 
		- If it's both closed and adiabatic, go home. It's dumb. Nothing happens.
	- In the open system, it'd be so neat if it was always $\dot{m}_{inlet}=\dot{m}_{outlet}$ 
		- That does not always happen. Maybe there are shenanigans at place with some process in the middle, tank is leaky, shitty measurement, outdated information, blah blah
			- $10.01=10.10$. I love math
- Shenanigans with an air compressor

![[Air Compressor Shenanigans]]
- You could solve for a couple things
	- $\dot{m}_{1}=\dot{m}_{2}$
		- I mean, probably not, because leaks are a pain in the neck, but you get it
	- More likely that you need to solve for power and how big this needs to be
	- If not adiabatic, could also be given heat transfer (ie, $Q=100kW$) 
- The only other closed system other than a tank that really comes up is piston cylinders
	- There was one on the homework!
- "Computational fluid dynamics" sounds objectively horrifying
- Flow of the class is Vocab $\to$ Equation $\to$ Exam
	- We really just kind of have conservation of energy/mass, and then getting horribly, horribly confused somewhere along the way.
