- EES is not case sensitive, variable names can be up to 30 characters
	- Semicolons work to split lines
- Comments are with `{}` or `""`
	- `{}` comments don't show in the formatted equations window
- Use a parametric table to vary one or more variables
	- So *this* is the equivalent of how loops work
	- Type your equation as normal, make a table to vary it, bob is uncle.
- EES looks ugly as sin because all of the resources went into speeeeeed.
- The function `Convert(unit1,unit2)` spits out a conversion factor that you can multiply by
- You need to use `ConvertTemp(unit1,unit2,temp)`
- You can declare units with numbers, but not types.
- The variable info window is where you do a lot of things, the check units button does like, a bit of a vibe check.
- Can do arrays and loops but we unfortunately skipped over them
- Property plots (making phase diagrams) are in fact totally possible
