### Housekeeping
- Finish up Rankine today, then review on Monday/Wednesday

### Assorted Other Rankine Notes
- Mostly working with feedwater heaters today
	- Including the homework problem, neat

#### Traps
- What a trap does is trap the condensate from the pressure drop across the trap, enthalpies are the same though

w_{net}=wt-wp_{1}-wp_{2}

$$
\eta_{th}=\frac{w_{net}}{Qin}

Q_{in}=h_{5}-h_{4}

$$
w_{p_{1}}=(1-y)(h_{1}-h_{2})

wp_{2}=h_{3}-h_{4}

COE Across the Closed FW
$$
\dot{m}_{6}(h_{6}-h_{3})=\dot{m}_{2}(h_{2}-h_{8})
$$
- Bleed, $y = \frac{\dot{m}_{6}}{\dot{m}_{5}}$
$$
y(h_{6}-h_{3})=(1-y)(h_{2}-h_{8})
