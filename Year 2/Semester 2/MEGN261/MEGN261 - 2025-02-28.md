## Couple Things that Happen Here
1.  Sgen of this, sgen of that, yadayada
2. cp/cv, air entropy, etc
3. Isentropic efficiency fun
$$
\eta_{T}^{(}= \frac{\text{actual w}}{\text{ideal w}} = \frac{h_{2a}-h_{1}}{h_{2s}-h_{1}}
$$
$$
\eta_{c} \text{ or } \eta_{p} = \frac{\text{ ideal w}_{s}}{\text{ actual w}_{a}} = \frac{h_{2s}-h_{1}}{h_{2a}-h_{1}}
$$
- S is ideal, a is actual
$$
q-w_{a} = \Delta h + \Delta ke + \Delta pe
$$
$$
 w_{a}= \Delta h
$$
- So now when we're setting up our states

- Constant entropy in the ideal state, so a straight line, less than ideal state it's a moving to the right because of that damn universe thing.

| State 1     | State 2                               | State 3        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| p1 is given | p2 given                              | p2             |
| t1 is given | s2s is a lookup, but = s1 since ideal | something else |
| h1 lookup   | h2s = (p2,s1) lookup (in EES)         | lookup for h2a |
| s1 lookup   |                                       |                |
$$
\frac{\cancel{ cp }(T_{2a}-T_{1})}{\cancel{ cp }(T_{2s}-T_{1})} \to \left( \frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}} \right) = \left( \frac{P_{2}}{P_{1}} \right)^{k-1/k}
$$
$$
T_{2}s=T_{1}\left( \frac{P_{2}}{P_{1}} \right)^{k-1/k}
$$

## Seven on the Homework (Compressor Problem)
- We're dealing with Argon as the fluid, which is in fact an ideal gas.
	- First thing to do is get the k value for argon, which is cp/cv, and for argon is 1.667

| State 1     | State 2 (ideal) | State 3 (ideal) |
| ----------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| p1 = 200kPa | p2 = 2MPa       | p2 = 2MPa       |
| t1 = 48°C   | T2s=??          | t2=550°C        |
- Adiabatic (q=0) , steady state device (d/dt = 0)
- If we're given power, you're probably going to have to solve for output temperature, otherwise assume actual.
- We're using a compressor, so $\eta_{C}$
$$
\eta_{C}=\frac{T_{2}s-T_{1}}{T_{2}a-T_{1}}
$$
$$
321K\left( \frac{2000kPa}{200kPa} \right)^{\frac{1.667-1}{1.667}}=806.5K
$$
$$
\eta_{C}=\frac{806.5-321}{823-321}=0.967=96.7\%
$$

### Ok similar compressor vibe, but you gotta actually do lookups with R-134a
- Just do the lookups quick and dirty with EES.
- Refrigerant / Water you look up h1 and s1, p2 h2s, and h2a
