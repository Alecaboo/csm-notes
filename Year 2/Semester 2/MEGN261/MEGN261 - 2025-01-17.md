### types of work
1. Shaft
	1. Pump, compressor, steam turbine, gas turbine
![[drod gas handwriting sample]]
- Just leaving this in here as a record for handwriting
2. Boundary Work
	1. Piston cylinder is the literal only way that this comes up in Thermo 1. $W = P dV$, pressure times change in volume
		- . Which is literally just $\forall_{2}-\forall_{1}$ 
		-  And we just care about the volume *contained by the piston*, not above, not below, what's inside the darn thing
			- An expansion is increasing in volume, compression is decreasing
3. Electrical Work (RCIII type shit)
	-  $w_{electrical} =V*I$ 
	- After exam 1 this never comes up again, merry christmas. (we're not going to talk about EEGN281. )
-----------------
#### 2nd Law Statements
- There's a good deal of things that don't technically violate the first law, but we have the second law to be a fucking ðŸ¤“ and yell at us about it 

- First up, efficiency
	- $\eta_{th}$ is thermal efficiency
	- $0-1*100$
	- Equation for $\eta_{th} = \frac{w_{net}}{Q_{in}}$
		- $w_{net}$ is profit - cost (econ major type equation. generally the profit is bigger. i feel like a business major typing this.)

- $\eta_{th}$ comes up the whole damn semester

## chapter 3: the fun part
- The whole gimmick here is phase change
![[Phase change]]
- The mixture is also referred to as "quality" - how much vapor is in the steam, which is relevant for steam blades and such
	- Quality uses $x$, which is $\leq 0.8$ 
- As you go more right more vapor, more left more liquid (left is liquid! at least that works out nicely)
- We use a particular pump called a "radial flow pump," which *requires* an input of saturated liquid
	- We add pressure to push it to a higher elevation, which leads to a compressed liquid coming out
	- 
- We say we have some steam turbine, we could run it at 0.8 quality, but why bother if we don't want liquid on the blades? So just push it to superheated vapor 
	- As the steam expands through the turbine, it drops in phase down to mixture
- Anything that has to do with saturated liquid has the subscript $_{f}$, and anything with saturated vapor has to deal with $_{g}$
- Vapor content (quality, $x$) is $\frac{m_{vapor}}{m_{liquid}+m_{vapor}}$ (you could also do water content but like irrel)
- Given any of the quantities we care about, $x = \frac{v - v_{f}}{v_{g}-v_{f}}= 0 <x<1$ 
	- you don't need $v$, could be $h_{f}$ or $u_{g}$ or what have you
- Dealing with some examples
	- If temperature is greater than $T_{sat}$, we're a superheated vapor
	- If temp is less than $T_{sat}$, we're a compressed liquid
	- If it's the same, you quite unfortunately have three possible phases. Go fish.
- We're a furniture store, we've got some tables
	1. You start on the saturated mixture table
	2. If things go poorly, you go to over to either the superheated vapor table or the compressed liquid table
- We have tables for Water and R-134<sub>a</sub>, which is a refrigerant that is now banned for consumer use (womp womp)

| P<sub>kPa</sub> | T<sub>T<sub>sat</sub></sub> | v<sub>f</sub> | v<sub>g</sub> | u<sub>f</sub> | u<sub>g</sub> | h<sub>f</sub> | h<sub>g</sub> | entropy jumpscare |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| blah            |                             |               |               |               |               |               |               |                   |
| blah            |                             |               |               |               |               |               |               |                   |
| lah             |                             |               |               |               |               |               |               |                   |
| 200             | 310                         |               |               |               |               |               |               |                   |
- Say you get given a pressure of 200, and a temperature of 340. 
	- You look at the table, go damn, 310 is not 340, so you move on to the superheated table in this case
	- Say you get given a temperature of 280, you leave to the compressed table
- I do not intend to draw phase diagrams when bored, but, I appreciate the sentiment.
