### more fun with the big dome diagram
![[Phase change]]
- That one, for the record
- If you had a graph with pressure as your dome, a constant temperature line would be the opposite, start going down, go across, and come down

### now to go to the tables
#### Table A-5: Saturated water - Pressure table
- One of the table entries is evaporation
$$x = \frac{v-v_{f}}{v_{s}-v_{f}}= \frac{10-0.00101}{14.67-0.001010}=0.682$$
- That's more vapor-y, just for records sake
- If you were for some reason going the other way
- If you get fucked and something is in between temperature values, google "Linear Interpolation calculator" and go have fun with that
	- We learn EES after exam 1 which can actually do that for you
- Chapter 4 is closed systems
	- Now hang on, we've talked about those
- Chapter 5 is open systems
	- Now hang on, we've talked about those
- You're going to have to get good at lookups because that's a very very large part of the exam 

### We only deal with ideal gasses in here
- Which behave predictably
	- Air, propane, argon (make sure it doesn't expire in three days), a whole list
$$P\forall=nRT$$
- Is quite, quirky, has moles, don't give a fuck.
- Publishers came up with the "perfect" gas law
$$m = \frac{P\forall}{RT}$$
- the $R$ in this equation is species specific
	- Some relevant unit bits - your temperature needs to be in Kelvin, pressure in kPA, volume in $m^{3}$, R has some funky units to cancel the rest of that out to get kg out
		- for instance, 0.287 for "air"
$$\frac{P_{1}\forall_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{P_{2}\forall_{2}}{T_{2}}$$
- That's if we're told mass is constant and we're sticking with the same gas, so, lots of fun relationships there where simple relationships can make the algebra like actually possible
- Be incredibly, remarkably careful that you don't do a lookup when you're really dealing with a gas, or vice versa
