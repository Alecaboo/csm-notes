- We've only really been talking about the left hand side of conservation of energy, $\dot{Q}$ and $\dot{w}$

If we write it aaaaalll out, we get

$$\dot{Q}-\dot{w}= \dot{m}( ? + \text{KE + PE} )$$
- All of the bits in the parenthesis need to be specific - ie, $\frac{kJ}{kg}$ 
	- When ya see kinetic energy, think "velocity"
		- Velocity started as m/s, kinetic energy, as a vibe, is $\frac{V^{2}}{2}$ 
			- notably, that gives units of $\frac{m^{2}}{s^{2}}$, which is, how you say, not kj/kg
			- If you multiply by 1000 in the denominator, that turns it into $\frac{kj}{kg}$
			- So the book will just have the equation $\frac{V^{2}}{2*1000}$ 
$$\text{Kinetic energy} =\frac{V^{2}}{2000}$$
- Quick pipe aside $$\dot{m} = \rho AV, \text{ or } \dot{m} = \frac{AV}{v}$$
	- Said pipe has an inlet and an outlet, which we call "states" here in thermo
		- We need two properties to fix a state
			- If we have pressure and temperature, we can determine phase
	- Writing $\Delta KE$ across this pipe would get you $\frac{V_{2}^{2}-V_{1}^{2}}{2*1000}$ 
## If you aren't given kinetic energy or velocity or anything - don't worry about it! Not your problem!
- Mechanical energy uses a lowercase $e$
	- Talking about $\text{ flow energy + kinetic energy + potential energy}$ 
		- We don't really use flow energy in here, which is pressure/density, or $\frac{P}{\rho}$ 
			- Alternatively, $Pv$ (pressure times specific volume) is also flow energy

#### Potential Energy
- Still needs to be kJ/kg, just for notes
- When vertical distance changes ($\Delta z$, in conventional nomenclature)
	- This math (in SI) is just $\Delta z *g$, which, again, units are wrong, buuuut, you just divide by 1000 again because metric was made by actually reasonable people and it all works out.
$$\text{Potential energy }= \frac{\Delta z*g}{1000}$$
- Don't have em, don't need em (unless you're using a computer, because at that point it's free, but, regardless)

![[The Great Drod Systems Flowchart]]
- There are two different vibes: if we're open or if we're closed
	- When we're open:$$\dot{Q} -\dot{w} = \dot{m}(\Delta h + \Delta ke + \Delta pe)$$
		- That $\Delta h$ is enthalpy! Enthalpy goes with open. Use the right equation. You will probably get very familiar.
	- Meanwhile, when we're closed, we get $$\dot{Q} -\dot{w} = \dot{m}(\Delta u + \Delta ke + \Delta pe)$$
		- $u$ is "internal energy," which apparently never comes up past exam 1 
			- water stuck up in some tank for instance is stored or internal energy, and if you pop a valve and release it, off it goes (and it no longer becomes a closed system)
		- Also, am i tripping or is the right side always going to be zero when we're closed? like? am I missing something? why does what's inside matter at all?
			- well like $\dot{m}$ is going to be zero because if it's closed there's no mass transfer
	- Fun little note, enthalpy isn't, like, real
		- Strictly speaking, $h= u + Pv$ 
			- Which, in not strange characters, is internal energy + flow energy
--------------------

#### Fun with the power of a steam turbine
- You have some steam turbine with state one and state two (in/out at some speed(s))
	- got nothin on kinetic, got nothin on potential, we're given $-\dot{w}=\dot{m}(\Delta h)$
- Homework problem where we get given $\dot{Q}-\dot{w}=\dot{m}(\Delta u)$ 

### you can't just sit and daydream about problems for six hours <sub>WRONG! watch me!</sub>
- can get mass in a tank by going $\frac{\forall}{v}$ (rigid tank over specific volume )
