## Engines! Of the Diesel variety
- Rudolf Diesel was the guy who invented diesel engines (crazy)
- There's no spark plugs, all just based upon compressing the shit out of it until it go kabloomy
- Diesel fuel vs gasolien
- $r$ is much higher for diesel, we can go well above 20
	- 8-13ish for otto engines
- $r_{c}$ is the cutoff ratio
	- (new term)
- $V\llap{-}_{co}$ is cutoff volume
	- diesel exclusive term
![[single cylinder engine graph]]
- This is just the exact same model
	- Diesel's gimmick is that between 2 and 3, $p=c$ (constant pressure)
```
Qin = enthalpy()
Qout = intenergy()
temperature()
```
- Using these instead of $c_{v}$ and $c_{p}$ for EES
- Industries that use Diesel
	- The tiny little baby industries, like
		- Shipping
		- Agriculture
		- Construction
		- Mining
		- Boats
		- Generators
		- Consumer Diesel
- Why diesel for consumer cars?
	- MPG from 40-60, which is neat
	- Torque's neat! Gets you up the mountain
	- Biodiesel
		- Fast food trash makes great fuel
		- does in fact decrease miles per gallon, but you can make it in your garage
- Why is Diesel kill?
	- Lobbyists. 
	- Consumer demand ain't there
		- Strict regulations
		- PR! 
			- What complaints do people have?
				- Smell. Stinky.
					- We've solved that problem, it was an engineering issue with an engineering solution
				- Visual
					- Black smoke
				- Rough times starting
					- Computers and glow plugs solve that problem
		- Diesel fuel is more expensive
		- Maintenance is... maybe? More expensive? Depends
- Looking at a diesel problem, maybe?

- We still have four states!

| State 1          | State 2              | State 3 | State 4 |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| Still the given! | Still use k-equation |         |         |
- How your $r$ works, top dead center, bottom dead center is still all the same
$$
\underbrace{ r_{c} }_{ \text{Cutoff ratio} }= \frac{V\llap{-}_{co}}{V\llap{-}_{TDC}}
$$
$$
n_{c } *\frac{N}{2}=W_{net}
$$
$$
\eta_{th,Diesel}=\frac{W_{net}}{Q_{in}}= \frac{T_{1}\left( \frac{T_{4}}{T_{1}}-1 \right)}{kT_{2}\left( \frac{T_{3}}{T_{2}}-1 \right)}= 1-\frac{1}{r^{k-1}}
$$
$$
\frac{T_{3}}{T_{4}}=\left( \frac{r}{r_{c}} \right)^{k-1}
$$
- There's a frankly gross amount of equations that are lowkey hard to see

### Example problem
- 4 cylinder 3L diesel engine, operates with an ideal diesel cycle and a compression ratio of 18 and a cutoff ratio of 3, with $T_{1}=25$ and $P_{1}=95$ mk how much power will the engine deliver at 1700 rpm
$$
r=18, r_{c}=3
$$
- We're looking for $\dot{w}_{net}$

| State 1       | State 2                                | State 3            | State 4                                                    |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| $T_{1}=25C$   | $T_{2s}=T_{1}r^{k-1}$<br>$T_{2s}=947K$ | $T_{3}=T_{2}r_{c}$ | $\frac{T_{3}}{T_{4}}=\left( \frac{r}{r_{c}} \right)^{k-1}$ |
| $P_{1}=95$kPa |                                        |                    |                                                            |
- We need some constants rq
	- $c_{v}=0.717$, $c_{p}=1.4(?)05$, $k=1.4$, $R=0.287$
- Mass is $\frac{PV\llap{-}}{RT}=\frac{95\left( \frac{3*10^{-3}}{4} \right)}{0.287(25+273)}$ which si then some 
$$
r_{c}=\frac{v_{3}}{v_{2}}=\frac{T_{3}}{T_{2}}
$$
- Remember for Diesel only P2=P3
$$
{w}_{net}=Q_{in}-Q_{out}
$$
$$
= mc_{p}(T_{3}-T_{2})-mc_{v}(T_{c_{1}}-T_{1})
$$
$$
\dot{w}_{net}=4 * \frac{\left( \frac{1700}{60} \right)}{2}*w_{net}
$$
- Do recall that the /2 is for 4 stroke engines
