## Plot Discussion
- Plot looks about as expected - as you vary turbine efficiency, I expect the work to go up (linearly) since the turbine is what's actually doing the work, and efficiency isn't being squared or anything, so a linear increase absolutely checks out. Getting closer to the ideal value previously calculated the closer $\eta$ gets to 1.
