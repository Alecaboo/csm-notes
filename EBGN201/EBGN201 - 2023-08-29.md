## Decision Making Core Principles

### [[Cost-Benefit Principle]]
- How much?
- Costs and benefits are incentives that shape decisions
	-  Taxes, government subsidies can all be incentives
- Measuring costs - price
- Measuring benefits - willingness to pay
	- 
- Maximize Economic surplus = Benefit - Cost
	- Firms want to maximize profits 

		- Perfect competitive market
			- Prices are fixed, market says what price to charge (low, beat out competitors)
			- Maximize profits by deciding how much product to produce, how much labor to hire
		- Market Power
			- Basically no competitors
			- Set prices, you can choose to reduce supply to increase price

### [[Opportunity Cost]]
- Next best options
- Not all out of pocket costs are opportunity costs
	- You need to pay rent no matter where you work - not truly a factor in decision making
- Non-out-of-pocket costs, you could, for example, be working instead of studying highi school
- Ignore sunk costs 
	- "I've already invested $100,000, I should keep going"
### [[Marginal Principle]]
- How Many
- Go incrementally
- Should I hire the first employee?
	- If the marginal benefit is greater than the marginal cost, hire them
	- Should I hire the second employee?
		- If the marginal benefit is greater than OR EQUAL TO the marginal cost, hire them
			- ....
			- Should I hire the ninth employee?
				- Marginal benefit is not greater than marginal cost, do not hire them
- Marginal benefit = marginal cost is still a gain - you're producing more product, even if profit doesn't change, it provides you with more resources and opportunities for benefits

### [[Interdependence Principle]]
- There are many other factors in the market other than just us - take into account the decisions others are making


Steps to evaluate an Investment Opportunity
1. compare the present value of costs and benefits
2. The present value of an up-front cost is the up-front cost
3. Convert future revenues into present values
4. Use the discounting formula to calculate the present value of a stream of future costs and revenues
5. Invest if the present value of benefits exceeds the present value of costs 

Discounting Formula
Revenue are less valuable in the future compared to today, because you can't invest them

$$Present \ value = Future \ value * \frac{1}{(1+r)^t}$$


- Economics is not a zero sum - in most cases, both sides win with an economic surplus

#### Hecla Mining Trucks

- Use the discounting formula silly


- Decreasing marginal utility 

### Pizza Activity
- Luna would be willing to buy 4 slices of pizza at $1.50 each - this is the maximum she can purchase while maintaining a positive cost/benefit ratio
- Luna would choose to eat 6 pieces of pizza on the all you can eat plan - this is as many pieces of pizza as she is willing to pay for (eating the 7th would require someone to pay her, which this is not) 
- Luna should decide to purchase the $6 all you can eat pizza - she pays the same cost as 4 slices of pizza a la carte, but she gets an additional 2 pieces of pizza (for a total of 6) as part of the deal. 
- The absolute most Luna should be willing to pay for all you can eat pizza is $14 - this is the total of all pizza cost willingness (column C in the table)![[pizza slice willingness.png]]

## HINT
- We're going to have an either or question like this on the quiz - calculate the economic surplus for both
