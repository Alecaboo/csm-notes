SUBJECT: Increasing the Excise Tax on Beer




## Economic Rationales for Beer Tax
Increasing the excise tax on beer would represent a significant potential increase to tax revenue, in addition to increasing the demand for other alcoholic beverages. Upon performing the calculations, increasing the price of beer would be a significant gain in tax revenue - over 24 million dollars, accounting for the reduced quantity sold from increased price. Raising the price would reduce the total number of gallons of beer sold from 123.2 million gallons to 122.5 gallons, as the price of a gallon of beer would increase from $10.44 to $10.64. This accomplishes our goal of raising additional tax money, while on the other hand there are significant questions as to the effect on other alcoholic markets - elaborated upon in the **Impact on Other Markets** section of this memo.

### Effects of the tax
Most of the burden of this increased excise tax would be born by the consumer - the relatively low change in quantity of beer purchased mean that consumers would handle most of the economic load. This would allow brewers and other suppliers of beer to remain in business, while Colorado would be able to reap the benefits of the increased excise tax. While consumers might bear most of the burden, the relatively low change in price - only 1.92% - means that the amount of consumers that would be "shouldered out" of the market by the increased price is incredibly low - meaning this is a fair tax to inhibit.

Unfortunately, like all taxes, this is likely to cause a drop in the efficiency of the Colorado beer market - as Colorado currently has an incredibly low tax, our market has a very high efficiency, as buyers and sellers operate close to their marginal benefit and cost respectively. Increasing this tax would increase the inefficiency of our market significantly, which is a trade off of enacting this tax. 

### Impact on Other Markets
While more difficult to calculate the effect upon other markets, the decrease in the quantity of beer demanded (approximately 0.57% ) would be taken up by other alcoholic beverages. While this could have been a potential benefit from increasing the beer tax, the incredibly low change in quantity demanded for beer would lead to a fairly minuscule change across the alcoholic market for other beverages. Furthermore, other alcoholic beverages are much more responsive to changes in price than beer - wine, for example, is nearly three times as responsive in the short run to price changes. \[1] This means that if we were to only increase the price of beer, these beverages and other related markets are likely to change significantly less than if we were to apply a tax to wine and examine the increase of beer sales. 


## Comparison to Other States
Colorado currently stands as one of the lowest excise taxes in the entire nation - only a handful of states, including Wyoming, Wisconsin, and Missouri have lower excise taxes. Raising the tax to $0.28 would still keep Colorado below the average beer tax throughout the nation, which stands at $0.34 as of 2021. \[2] Furthermore, while $0.28 is higher than Wyoming and Kansas, it remains lower than other neighboring states, including New Mexico and Utah, so there would be no issues with residents purchasing significant quantities of alcohol in other states and moving them back to Colorado. While Federal excise taxes have no impact upon whether or not we should increase our tax - as they remain constant, regardless of what we do - it is still a fact of some note that raising the excise tax, combined with the federal tax, would make the total excise tax upon beer $0.70. Values mentioned  are represented in the attached table below.

## Summary
Governor, I fully recommend increasing the excise tax on beer. Increasing the tax would lead to a significant of over 24 million dollars in tax revenue, without a significant change in the quantity of beer sold. Raising the tax would have little impact on the rest of the alcoholic beverage market, as many consumers would continue to purchase beer even with the increase in price. Furthermore, raising the excise tax would only serve to average Colorado out compared to the rest of the United States - at $0.28, Coloradan excise tax would remain below the national average.
