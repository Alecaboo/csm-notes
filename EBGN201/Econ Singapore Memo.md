## Economic Growth Analysis
 Economic growth in Singapore has been fairly consistently trending down, across nearly all factors, for the last fifty years. Growth was largely driven by increases in capital stock, with increases in the labor force representing a consistent, if low growth throughout the last several decades. Technological progress, on the other hand, represents an incredibly volatile factor when considering the growth of Singapore - sometimes being one of the most significant factors to growth (such as in the 1960s), or doing nothing at all (like in the 2010s), or even being a detriment to growth (as seen in the 1970s).

## Specific Analysis of the 1970s
Singapore experienced an incredibly large degree of growth during the 1970s, with the most significant growth in the labor force in the period analyzed, in addition to the largest growth in capital stock since the end of World War II. The most significant factor in this growth was a massive economic drive by Prime Minister Lee, who recognized the value of foreign investments and greatly encouraged several electronic manufacturing companies, including Texas Instruments, to invest in Singapore. \[1]. Lee's economic growth programs, in addition to realizing the value of serving as a trade city throughout Southeast Asia, lead to a significant boom in the Singaporean economy. 

Even more interesting, however, is the increase in the labor force - natural growth in Singapore had been booming since the end of the war \[2], and there was a fairly low quantity of immigration in the 1970s - only about 24,000 individuals. This means that the increase in the labor force was caused purely by a "baby boom," similar to that experienced in the United States, finally hitting the Singapore labor market. 

The reason changes in technology represented a negative impact on the economy was simply due to the massive increase in the preceding several decades - Singapore only experienced full freedom from the British empire in 1971, and as such, was still negotiating its own technological place in the world. Lee's economic programs focused entirely on enticing foreign investors in - their investments would only begin to bear fruit in the terms of manufacturing plants and factories in the following decades.

## Recommendation to The Board
Directors, I firmly recommend against investing in Singapore at this time. Economic growth in Singapore has been consistently trending down over the last several decades, and due to Singapore's nature as an island city-state, our investment would provide minimal opportunities for further economic growth. Space is a commodity in Singapore, and other international investors, such as Texas Instruments and Hewlett Packard, already have "skin in the game," having invested significant capital over the last several decades in Singapore. Investing further at Singapore at this time is unlikely to represent a significant return and incredibly likely to cost more capital than it generates, especially in the short term, with current trends of Singapore's economic growth. 

Furthermore, historical economic growth in Singapore was largely driven through the actions of a now absent benevolent dictator, Prime Minister Lee - without a significant reason for economic growth, I believe Singapore will continue to trend down and stagnate - leading to a poor site for our investment.
