1. New longwall technology
	1. New longwall technology providing dramatically increased production would increase coal supply, providing the means to shift on the coal supply curve.![[coal supply changes.png]]
			1.Leftmost arrow is the original, with rightmost arrow being the shfited supply curve with more product availible.
2. A subsidy for power plants that use coal to produce electricity
	1. A subsidy for power plants that use coal would increase the demand for coal, causing the demand curve to shift to the right (as more product is required)
	2. ![[coal subsidy demand curve.png]]
3. Increased concern for the effects of burning coal on the climate
	1. Increased environmental concerns would decrease the demand for coal, causing the demand curve to shift to the left (as there is less requirement for coal)
	2. ![[environmental concern demand curve.png]]
4. An environmental policy that regulates the amount of sulfur
	1. An environmental policy regulating sulfur would reduce the amount of viable coal, causing the supply curve to shift left (as there is less viable product)
	2. ![[coal supply changes.png]]
		1. Production starts out on the right arrow, and shifts to the left as less is available
