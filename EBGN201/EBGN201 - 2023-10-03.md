# Market Power
- Firms with many competitors tend to just take prices as the market gives them
	- Needs lots of buyers and sellers
	- Demand curve is basically just a flat line
- No competitors
	- Unique product, no competitors, lots of market power 
- Most firms in the US are facing Monopolistic competition - there's few competitors, which is what we call an oligopoly
	- Steeper slope of the demand curve the higher the market power


If we're a firm with market power, we can raise price to increase profit 

Firm's marginal revenue curve measures the incentive to increase production

## Demand Curves
Three kinds
1. Market Demand
	1. The entire pizza market - Oasis and all competitors
2. Firm demand
	1. An individual firm - like that Oasis pizza restaurant
3. Individual demand
	1. Just you, your personal demand curve

# What is marginal revenue?
- What happens to total profit when we produce and sell one more unit?
- Total revenue and marginal revenue are a function of quantity
- Quantity is a function of price
- 


- Fixed costs do not depend on quantity
	- Variable costs do, which is kind of in the name
- Marginal revenue - marginal cost = 0
- $$\frac{d\pi}{dq}=\frac{dTR(q)}{dq}-\frac{dC(q)}{dq}=0$$
- Discount effect is the amount that you must lower the price in order to sell an extra unit
- Output effect is the amount you gain from selling an additional unit
- When you apply the product rule to the total revenue function $TR = p(q) * q$, you end up with the output effect $p(q)*1$ + the discount effect, $(q*\frac{dp(q)}{dq})$ 
- Derivative of price relative to quantity
- Marginal revenue and Marginal cost gets us a quantity - but we need to plug that quantity in to the *demand* curve to figure out what price we should actually charge
	- Market power is causing this deadweight loss
- If you *don't* have market power, you can make as many units as you damn well please
	- Firms in a perfectly competitive market have no discount effect
