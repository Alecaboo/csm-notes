- Tin prices experienced an upswing in 2009-2011\[1], with matching downswing to 2015,  followed by fairly volatile prices throughout 2015 to 2020, followed by a massive upswing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Prices have returned to somewhat regular values following the pandemic, although they are still nearly as high as the pre-pandemic record high prices. 
- The period of price upswing in 2009-2011 was caused by a surge in demand from China and other nations expanding their industrial facilities \[2]. According to the International Tin Association, the reason that this caused such a significant increase in price is because the production of tin had been constant starting in 2005, and even starting to decline as some mines and other producers dried up. From the European Central Bank, demand continued to increase with only minor supply changes, leading to a price shift across the entire metal market, and by extension, tin. \[3] Metal prices began to trend down following 2011, as tin producers scaled up production to match the mounting demand. Supplies continued to increase, leading to the swing down in 2014 - prices continued to decline, while demand remained stagnant. \[4]

- This supply and demand curve demonstrates what happened to tin markets during the 2011 price spike - supply remained
constant (represented by the black arrow pointing up and to the right), while demand increased noticeably (represented by the original demand of the curved black arrow, with new demand represented by the red arrow). This graph represents how as quantity demanded increased without an increase in supply, prices increased - leading to the noticeable spike in prices.

- The following downswing is represented by this second supply & demand curve - demand remains constant, represented by 
the red curving line, while supply increases, represented by the new green line pointed up to the right. This clearly demonstrates how supply increased, yet demand remained unchanged - causing equilibrium price to decrease (represented by the shift down in the y axis)
