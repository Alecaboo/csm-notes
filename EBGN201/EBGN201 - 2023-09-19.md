### Corn Price Increase
1. Corn production encountered several serious challenges throughout the 2010 and 2011 planting season - according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service, several agricultural regions were faced with adverse weather - including a 2010 drought in the United States and Argentina, a 2011 freeze of Mexico's corn production, as well as excessive rains delaying the 2011 American corn planting season. \[1] 
2. These factors would lead to a decrease in supply, with no significant change in demand - causing the supply curve to shift to the left, as there is less total material available. 
3. The shift of the graph would cause a higher equilibrium price, as the demand is unchanged, yet the supply curve is shifted to the side - necessitating a higher price. 
4. This quick sketch of the supply demand graph represents the corn market - the red line shows demand, which is (fairly) constant throughout 2011-2012. The green line represents the original supply of corn before the adverse factors (drought, weather, etc), while the blue line shows the shifted supply curve. As the supply curve shifts to the left, it's very clear how the equilibrium price shifts higher along the curve. ![[Screenshot 2023-09-19 at 8.47.35 AM.png]]
 My analysis is reinforced by the FRED graph of corn data \[2], which shows the increase in price throughout 2011 (due to lack of supply), followed by an increase in price in 2012 due to the reduction in supply from the adverse weather in 2011. ![[Screenshot 2023-09-19 at 8.50.17 AM.png]]
