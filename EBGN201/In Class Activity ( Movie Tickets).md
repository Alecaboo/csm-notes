## Part 1
For senior citizens, 

$$Q = 5.714 - \frac{p}{2.45}$$
So for seniors, at $12 a ticket, quantity demanded would be equal to 0.816 average tickets per showing

Multiplying profit * quantity, total revenue = $14q-2.45q^{2}$
taking the derivative of total revenue with respect to quantity gets us marginal revenue, $14-4.9q$
Finding where MR = MC occurs at Quantity = 2.041, plugging back in to the original senior citizen pricing gives us a price of $9

## Part 2
- Consumer Surplus
	- Old surplus of 0.816
	- New Surplus of 5.1025
		- (2.041/2) \*5
	- So consumers are better off with price discrimination
- Producer Surplus
	- Old surplus of 6.529
	- New Surplus are 10.204
	- Producer is also better off
- Both consumers and producers are better off, wonderful.
