## friction
- really, truly, is a sneaky son of a bitch
	- kinetic friction really isn't that bad
	- static friction is lazy
		- only has whatever magnitude it needs in order to prevent motion
		- summary of a whole lot of demonstration: pain in the ass

##### clicker
- push a book such that it slides to the right
	- This means we have static friction to the left


#### block
- you pull on a block with a rope downward with increasing $\theta$, what happens to the normal force?
	- goes up
		- oh hey, we'll need that to calculate friction
- $\mu$ is constant in this class, in real life we... honestly don't really know. shit's weird.

- friction opposes relative slip, so if you're sitting on a conveyor belt, static friction is probably going to drag you along
