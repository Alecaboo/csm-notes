1. WeBWorK  1
	1. No acceleration in the x direction, and since we're a positive height $h$ above the ground, down is negative
	2. Given that $\theta$ is the angle down off the roof, that means that the $v_{1}\cos\theta$ would represent the x component of the velocity - y component is the same but negative and based on the $\sin\theta$, as we've established that down is negative
	3. Y is the only factor that determines time in the air, so that must be used
	4. Range is how far it travels in x in a given time, so we need to plug in the time to determine
	5. Time to hit the ground is purely determined by how long it takes to fall down - so $y$ position is the only factor that determines how long the acorn is in the air
2. WeBWorK 2
	1. No x acceleration, y is just -g
	2. X component of the velocity is just the x component of the initial velocity, y component varies with time, so it's the y component of the initial velocity - the constant acceleration * time
	3. Position functions are just integrations, but in respect to time - so all the $v_{i}\cos(\theta)$ garbage is just constant, so the integrals are actually pretty straight forward
	4. 

$$0=4 - 5*\sin(30)*t - \frac{1}{2}gt^{2}$$
$$0=4-2.5t -4.905t^2$$
$$-4.905t^{2}-2.5t+4=0$$
$$\frac{2.5\pm \sqrt{2.5^{2}-4(-4.905)(4)}}{8}=0.684$$
$$t=0.684\text{s}$$

$$5*\cos(\theta)*0.684= 2.96\text{m}$$


3. WeBWorK 3
	1. Lots of reasoning for the first couple
	2. $0=5*9.8t$
	4. $x_{a}=2.7$
		1. $x_{v}=2.7t$
			1. $x_{p}=\frac{2.7}{2}t^{2}$
	5.
