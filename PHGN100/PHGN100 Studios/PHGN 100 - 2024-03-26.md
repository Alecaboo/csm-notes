We know the distance $x$, we know the spring constant $k$, we know the mass of the ball $m_{b},$ the radius of the sphere $r_{b}$, and I believe we know the height $h$

Different concepts:

It gets launched, it starts rolling, it's got kinetic energy from moving, wham bam


Since it's translationally at rest at the apex of its motion, the only difference in the states is the rotation

Meanwhile, from the launch point to the apex, the only change is in translational, as nothing is causing it to spin.
