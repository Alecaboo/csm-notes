We're looking at the system of the elevator, with outside forces from the cable and the Earth.
$$\sum\limits_{j}\vec{T}_{ce}-\vec{W}_{Ee}=m_{e}*\vec{a}_{e}$$
$$\vec{T}_{ce}-(m_{e}*g)=m_{e}*\vec{a}_{e}$$
$$a_{e,x}=0$$
$$\frac{\vec{T}_{ce}-gm_{e}}{m_{e}}=\vec{a}_{e,y}$$
This could be rewritten in a $y=mx+b$ format, which is why our line is linear.

When $T_{ce}=m_{e}(g)$, acceleration would be equal to 0 - this is the x intercept on our graph, and you could simply divide tension by little $g$ to get the mass. 

### follow up questions
1. I solidified the relationship between the sum of the forces and acceleration - consider the forces on a certain object, and summing them up will A - probably lead to an algebraic relationship and B - yield the acceleration
2. I'm confused on how the slope of the graph is relevant to the PSSD - it's just some arbitrary number, as the tension is supposed to be changing randomly, and while the equation could be rearranged to $\frac{1}{m_{e}}$T, I still feel like this isn't a relevant number to consider.
