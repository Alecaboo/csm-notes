$$f_{g}= mg$$
$$\int f_{g}= mgt $$ 
When can we ignore a force?
In this situation, the force was exerted over an incredibly short time, leading to an incredibly low value for gravity - especially compared to the force from the normal force, which did scale with time. 


Earth
$$\frac{13.5}{ (5.974*10^{24})}$$

- Gravitational impulse was so much smaller because it was being multiplied by the incredibly short time and the fairly low mass of the ball.
