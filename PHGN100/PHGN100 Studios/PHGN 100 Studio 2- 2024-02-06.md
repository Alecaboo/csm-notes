System is the box (defined by b)
Knowns: m = 30kg, $\mu$ for block = 0.29 static, 0.22 kinetic, $V_{o}$ of truck/block is 25 m/s 
Unknown: Distance

Maximum static force is $\mu*m*g$, 85.347N
Acceleration = $\vec{f}_{s,max}/m$ = 2.8449 m/s^2

  
d𝑡 = 𝑣 (𝑡i) + ∫ 𝑎(𝑡′)d𝑡′

$dt=v(t_{i})+\int(a(t')dt')$ 



$V= 25 - 2.8449t$
8.788 seconds to stop, solving velocity for 0 
$d = 25t -\frac{2.8449t^{2}}{2}$
Plug and chug the time into this equation, bam bang boop, there you go. 

- It's a minimum distance because going any longer distance would reduce the acceleration further, so we're trying to solve for the maximum acceleration (which happens in a minimum distance)
