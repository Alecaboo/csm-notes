Momentum is convserved

So final = $$6 \hat\imath + 0\hat\jmath$$
$$v_{2f}*\sin(\theta) = v_{2f}y$$
$$v_{2f}* \cos(\theta) = v_{2f}x$$

$$p_{x}= (v_{2fx} *m_{2})+ (v_{3fx}*m_3)$$
$$6 = (v_{2f}*\cos(\theta)* m_{2})+ v_{3fx}*m_{3} $$
$$(6 - (1.5 * cos( 50 deg) * 2))/4$$

$$0 = (v_{2f}* \sin(\theta) * m_{2}) + v_{3fy}*m_{3}$$

The center of mass's velocity didn't change! There were no forces external to the system, so there was nothing capable of causing the velocity of the center of mass to change. There were internal forces, so components of the system could have a change in velocity, but the otherwise entirely internal forces mean no changes.
