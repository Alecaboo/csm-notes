I used 1/2/3/4 instead of a/b/c/d because it formatted better

![[PSSD Pos Graph 1.25.24]]
1. $\vec v(0)=0\hat\imath+v_{0}\hat\jmath$
2. $\vec v(t)=v_{0}-\frac{At^{2}}{2}$
	$$0=v_{0}-\frac{At^{2}}{2} \ \ \ \frac{At^{2}}{2}=v_{0}$$
	
	$$t_{1}=\sqrt{\frac{v_{0}}{0.5A}}$$
3. $$v_{\text{east}}=\int_{t_1}^{t_2} B\hat\imath=Bt\hat\imath$$
	$$v_{east}=v_{0}\ \ |Bt\hat\imath| = |\vec v_{0}|$$
	$$t=\frac{v_{0}}{B}$$
	$$t_{f}=t_{1}+ \frac{v_{0}}{B}$$
4. Average acceleration equation = $\frac{\vec v(t_{f})-\vec v(t_{i})}{t_{f}-t_{i}}$
$$|\vec{a}_{average}|=|\frac{<v_{0},0>-<0,v_{0}>}{\sqrt{\frac{v_{0}}{0.5A}}+\frac{v_{0}}{B}}|$$

Follow Up Question
1. The main concept I solidified from this PSSD is that when dealing with vectors, if you're only moving in pure units, it's actually rather easy to convert from vectors to their scalar magnitudes and vice versa - in this problem, our initial and final velocity are going in completely different directions, but we could still relate them in an equation due to the fact that they were due north and east respectively.
2. I'm worried that I did my vector notation entirely correctly, but otherwise this PSSD was just a whole pile of algebra shenanigans that were not really confusing, just somewhat roundabout.
