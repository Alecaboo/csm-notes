### N2L

$$\sum\limits \vec{f}_{y,1}= T_{21} -gm_{1}$$
$$\sum\limits \vec{f}_{y,1}= gm_{2}-T_{12}$$
$$am_{1}= T -gm_{1}$$
$$am_{2}=gm_{2}-T$$

---

$$a = \frac{T}{m_{1}}- \frac{gm_{1}}{m_{1}}$$
$$a = \frac{T}{m_{1}}-g $$

$$T = gm_{2}-am_{2}$$
$$a=\frac{gm_{2}-am_{2}}{m_{1}}-g$$
$$a+g = \frac{gm_{2}-am_{2}}{m_{1}}$$
$$(a+g)m_{1}= gm_{2}-am_{2}$$
$$am_{2} + am_{1}+ gm_{1}= gm_{2}$$
$$am_{2}+am_{1}=gm_{2}-gm_{1}$$
$$a(m_{2}+m_{1})= g(m_{2}-m_{1})$$
$$a= g\frac{m_{2}-m_{1}}{m_{2}+m_{1}}$$

$$a = \frac{gm_{2}-gm_{1}}{m_{2}+m_{1}}$$

$$T = gm_{2}- (\frac{gm_{2}-gm_{1}}{m_{2}+m_{1}})m_{2}$$



### Follow Up Questions
1. I learned that WeBWorK only accepts distributed answers, and as such I should try to simplify my answers as much as possible instead of leaving in an easier to understand form.
2. I found tension and acceleration being the same a tad counterintuitive when we were first presented with the assumptions, but thinking about it further and considering the free body diagrams, it makes considerably more sense.
