Goal here is to experimentally determine the spring constant of a spring through two different methods. 



When everything is in static equilibrium, (and at every other point), there are only two forces acting on the spring.

Because the system is in static equilibrium, the sum of the forces has to be 0, by N2L. This means that the weight of the mass on the end of the spring is equal to the force of the spring, ie $$k(x-x_{0})=m_{w}g$$
$$k = \frac{m_{w}g}{x-x_{0}}$$
So in order to determine $k$, all we have to do is determine how much farther the spring is stretched when at equilibrium - ie, $x-x_{0}$




When the spring is dynamically oscillating, the period is given by the equation.
$$\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m_{w}}}$$
$$\omega = 2\pi f, f = \frac{1}{T}$$
Solve this for the spring constant, and there you go.
$$$$
$$\omega^{2}= \frac{k}{m_{w}}$$
$$k = \left(2\pi * \frac{1}{f}\right)^{2}*m_{w}$$
So in order to determine the spring constant, time the oscillation time of the spring, then plug it in to the equation, and there you go.


## Observations
### Static Equilibrium 
- Unstretched spring length: 3.8 cm
- Stretched spring length: 7.75 cm
- $\Delta x = 7.75cm-3.8cm =3.95cm$
	- 0.0395m, so that we end up with N\*M
- Mass is 0.15kg
- So the $k$ at static equilibrium = $$\frac{0.15kg*g}{0.0395m}=37.25N/m$$
### Oscillating
- Time for 10 Oscillations
	- Trial 1: 4.88 seconds
	- Trial 2: 4.87
	- Trial 3: 4.56
	- Average Time for 10 oscillations: 4.77 seconds
	- Average time per oscillation: 0.477 seconds
- Mass of weight is still 0.15kg
- $$k = (2\pi\frac{1}{0.477})^{2}(0.15kg)=26.03 N*m$$
## Overall
- $k$ for static is = 37.25 N\*M, K for Oscillating is 26.03 N\*m
- So average $k$ is 31.64 N\*m

## Questions
1. I learned the amplitude really does not affect the period - I tried bouncing a different height every time, and the period did not change at all. Also the differences between frequency and whatever $\omega$ represents, which is not quite frequency.
2. I had fully thought $\omega$ was frequency, which I only realized is completely wrong when I plugged the numbers in and got something hilarious off from my previous measurement ofr static (which I was confident was right). This made me re-examine the equation sheet, and realize that $\omega$ isn't frequency, just related intrinsically to it.
