![[Two Cylinder PSSD Pain]]

- Let's call positive x to the left and counterclockwise to be the positive direction of rotation ( rotating about the center of mass of the object)
Sum of the forces
$$\sum\limits F = m *a_{cm}$$
$$m_{c}*a_{cm} = \vec{F}_{2C} - f_{fs,gC}$$

----

Sum of the torques
$$\sum\limits_{j}\vec\tau_{F_{jb}}=I_{cm}\vec{\alpha}_{cm}$$
$$\vec{F}_{2C}*r_{2}- \vec{F}_{1C}*r_{1} - f_{fs,gC}*r_{2} = I_{cm} \vec{\alpha}$$

---

No slip condition

$$a_{cm} = r_{2}*\alpha_{cm}$$


---

$$\vec{F}_{2C}*r_{2}- h\vec{F}_{2C}*kr_{2}- f_{fs,gC}r_{2}=bm_{c}r^{2}_{2}  \vec{\alpha_{cm}}$$
$$\vec{F}_{2C} - hk\vec{F}_{2c} - f_{fs,gC}=bm_cr_{2}\vec{\alpha_{cm}}$$

-----

$$f_{fs,gC}= \vec{F}_{2C}-hk\vec{F}_{2C}-bm_{c}r_{2}\vec{\alpha}_{cm}$$
$$m_{c}*a_{cm} = \vec{F}_{2C} - f_{fs,gC}$$



$$m_{c}*a_{cm}= \vec{F}_{2C} - ( -\vec{F}_{2C}-hk\vec{F}_{2c}-bm_{c}r_{2}\vec{\alpha}_b)$$
$$a_{cm}= \frac{\vec{F}_{2C}+ \vec{F}_{2C} + hk\vec{F}_{2C} + bm_{c}r_{2}\vec{\alpha}_{cm}}{m_{c}}$$
$$a_{cm}= -\left(\frac{hk\vec{F}_{2C}+bm_{c}r_{2}\vec{\alpha}_{cm}+2 \vec{F}_{2C}}{m_{c}}\right)$$
- So we realized we set our direction to left instead of right (because we have reading comprehension issues), and we really didn't want to rewrite the entirety of the PSSD, so we just slapped a negative out in front of this, which should just about solve all of our problems


---



$$a_{cm}= \frac{-hk\vec{F}_{2C}- bm_{c}r_{2}\vec\alpha_{cm}- 2\vec{F}_{2C}}{m_c}$$
$$a_{cm}= -\frac{hk\vec{F}_{2C}}{m_{c}} - br_{2}\vec{\alpha}_{cm}- \frac{2\vec{F}_{2C}}{m_{c}}$$
$$a_{cm}+ br_{2}( \frac{a_{cm}}{r_{2}})=   -\frac{hk\vec{F}_{2C}}{m_{c}} - \frac{2\vec{F}_{2C}}{m_{c}}$$
$$a_{cm}+ ba_{cm}= \frac{\vec{F}_{2C}}{m_{c}}( hk -2 )$$
- Given this, the product of $hk$ must be greater than 2 - if it's less than 2, the acceleration would be negative (and going the wrong way), and if it's equal to 2, acceleration is 0 (which is fine, but not the situation we care about)


## follow up questions!
1. Learned the importance of system choice and reading comprehension when attempting to get the right answer - we very nearly completely messed up the entire problem because we chose positive x to be to the left. 
2. Solidified the importance of algebra, tracking signs, and keeping a measure of the difference and relationship between $a$ and $\alpha$
