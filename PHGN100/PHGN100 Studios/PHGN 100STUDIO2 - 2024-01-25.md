Train 1 Pos
$$v_{1x}=v_{i1}\int_{0}^{t}-kt^{3}=v_{i1}+\frac{-kt^{4}}{4}$$
$$x_1(t)=\int_{0}^{t}v_{i} + \frac{-kt^{4}}{4}$$
$$x_{1}(t)= v_{i}t + \frac{-kt^{5}}{20}$$

Train 2 Pos

$$x_{2}(t)=d+v_{2i}t$$

Collision Shenanigans

$$10 = 20 - \frac{0.25t^{4}}{4}$$
$$\frac{0.25t^{4}}{4}=10||||  \ \ 0.25t^{4}=40 ||| \ \ t^{4}=160$$
$$t=3.56$$

$$20 (3.56)- \frac{(0.25)(3.56)^{5}}{20}=d+10(3.56)$$
$$\text{You just do algebra, I just plugged it in to my calculator}$$
$$d=28.45m$$

1. In order for the trains to just barely touch, they need to have the same velocity at their collision time, which is represented by having the same slope on the graphs. 
2. boop
	1. If at a shorter distance, they would collide and stick
	2. They would miss completely
