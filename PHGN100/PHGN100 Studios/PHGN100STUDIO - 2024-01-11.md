# Experimental Investigation
- Purpose of this is to examine what happens to position, velocity, and acceleration as a cart rolls down an inclined track and collides with a block, causing it to "turn around"

### EI Follow Up Questions
1. For me, this further solidified the relationship between position, velocity, and acceleration - when acceleration is relatively constant, velocity is going to be linear, and position is going to be roughly parabolic in some way. Also interesting is how much more pronounced the "bounces" off the wall at the end of the track are on the velocity and acceleration graphs compared to position. 
2. I'm curious as to what caused our acceleration to "jitter" on its way down the graph - it was probably just friction, but acceleration should've been reasonably constant and instead resembles a very small sinusoidal function.
3. If I had more time to play around with this setup, I would try to reduce friction in some way, either by cleaning the track or some other way, in order to see what reduced friction does to the graphs, especially acceleration and velocity.
