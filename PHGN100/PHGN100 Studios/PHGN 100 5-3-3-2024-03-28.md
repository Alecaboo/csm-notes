$$-\int_{x_{0}-d1}^{x_{0}+d2}-k*(x-x_{0})dx= k\int_{x_{0}-d1}^{x_{0}+d2}x-x_{0}dx $$
$$k ( \frac{x^{2}}{2}- x_{0}x)\Big|_{x_{0}-d_{1}}^{x_{0}+d_{2}}$$
$$k ( \frac{(x_{0}+d_{2})^{2}}{2}- x_{0}(x_{0}+d2))- k( \frac{(x_{0}-d_{1})^{2}}{2}- x_{0}(x_{0}-d_{1}))$$
$$-k ( \frac{d_{2}^{2}}{2})+ k ( \frac{(-d_{1})^{2}}{2} )$$

## if just block
1. Then the spring is an external force, and therefore...
2. Does work instead of hanging potential energy
3. It would probably be a fair bit harder to calculate, but there is no change in the actual physical state based on what we choose as our system.
