$$v_{x}(t)\int_{0}^{3}A-Bt$$
$$v_{x}(t)=\int_{0}^{3} 5t - \frac{0.6}{2}t^{2}=12.3 \text{ m/s}$$

$$x(3s)=\int_{0}^{3}5t - 0.3t^{2}=\frac{5}{2}t^{2}- \frac{0.3}{3}t^{3}=19.8m$$

$$\Delta x=12.3 \text{ m/s}*2 = 14.6m$$
- If there was a $V_{0}$ of 10 $\text{m/s}$, then the speed would get added on, so velocity would be 22.3 m/s, then you would also need to add $V_{0}t$ to the position, in addition to having to change the additional displacement due to the increased velocity.
