- Objective of this EI is to determine the coefficient of static friction between a block and ramp by testing different angles to determine when the force of gravity "overcomes" static friction.
- System is block. (labeled with B), ramp is labeled with R
- ![[2.1.1 EI Phys]]
$$\sum\limits_{j}\vec{F}_{jb}=m_{b}\vec{a}_{b,cm}$$
Defining the x direction as parallel to the ramp, and y is perpendicular to the ramp (with positive y being up and away from the ramp), and positive x is down the ramp

$$\sum\limits \vec{F}_{x}= \vec{f}_{s,RB} \ + \vec{W}_{EB}*\sin(\theta), =m_{b}*a_{x,b}$$
$$\sum\limits \vec{F}_{y} = \vec{N}_{BR} - \vec{W}_{EB}*\cos(\theta)$$
$$m_{b}*a_{x,b}=0, a_{x,b}=0$$
$$\mu *\vec{N}_{RB} =-\vec{W}_{EB}*\sin(\theta)$$
$$\vec{N}_{RB}= \vec{W}_{EB} *\cos(\theta)$$
$$\text{So we're ending up with}$$
$$\mu *\vec{W}_{EB} *\cos(\theta) = -\vec{W}_{EB} *\sin(\theta)$$
$$\mu = -\frac{\vec{W}_{EB}*\sin(\theta)}{\vec{W}_{EB}*\cos(\theta)} | | | \ \mu = -\frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} | | | \ \ \mu = \tan(\theta)$$
Ramp is 1.22 meters long
Trial 1: 0.62m, 26.83$\degree$, $\mu = 0.506$
Trial 2: 0.56m, 24.64 $\degree$, $\mu=0.459$
Trial 3: 0.605m, 26.36 $\degree$, $\mu=0.496$ 
Average $\mu$ of $0.487$ 

## Follow Up Questions
1. Just solidified a lot of the math involved with which force was $\cos(\theta)$ vs $\sin(\theta)$, which was a value that I vaguely remembered in my head, but fully working through the math was good for solidifying my understanding. 
2. When I initially did my work, I got $\mu = -\tan(\theta)$ and was confused as to where my negative sign came from, and realized that I had subtracted a force instead of just allowing the directions to do their own scaling of the negative, which is generally poor practice.
3.
