$$f_{N,m_{2}m_{1}}= f_{y}*\sin(\theta)+W_{Em_{1}}$$
$$f_{n}=28.1N$$

$$f_{fk}=f_{N,m_2m_1}*\mu$$
$$f_{fk}= 8.43N$$
$$8.43N \frac{}{8kg}=1.05m/s^2 $$

Yep, you could absolutely solve if the blocks were treated as one cohesive system. You would just view blocks combined, and the force as applied to the entire system, not considering internal forces.
