- Fun fact, you can approximate just about any function with a polynomial series
	- We'll get to that in calc 2.... later
	- This also means that we can approximate just about any *force* with a polynomial series
- $f= \frac{1}{T}, \omega = 2\pi f$ 
- $f = \frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{k_{1}+k_{2}}{m_{b}}}$
