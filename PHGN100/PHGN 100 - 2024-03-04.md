[[PHGN100 - Block Two]]

### first clicker
- started with a rotating wheel, the tension in the direction of the rotation was larger (exploding head)

### clicker two
![[Pickaxe Sketch]]

- Reasoning behind picking the bottom left of the pickaxe is because any torque acting on the axis itself is going to be 0
- you could set the axis at where the two normal forces intersect but that's *cringe*

$$f_{s}\times DE = W_{EP}$$

alright, least # of equations possible, answer he gave was one, it's arguably two because you do need to get weight from the mass

## rotational statics
- block hang from cable on strut pin yadayada

Sure, let's sall that counterclockwise is positive

We have a weight force that acts on the block
Weight force on the strut
Tension from the rope, which is that we're solving for
There's some shenanigans going on at the pin as well


- hey, set your axis of rotation where you get to invalidate something you don't want to think about (read: the pin, in this case)

$$\sum\limits\vec{\tau} = \tau_{T_{GS}}- \tau_{W_{ES}}-\tau_{W{Eb}}$$
$$\sum\limits\vec{\tau}= dT_{GS}\sin(\theta)- \frac{L}{2}m_{s}g\sin(\Theta)-Lm_{b}g\sin(\Theta)=0$$
$$dT_{GS}\sin(\theta)=\frac{L}{2}m_{s}g\sin(\phi)+Lm_{b}g\sin(\phi)$$
- Quick bit o mathematical shenanigans
- 
$$T_{gs}= \frac{Lg\sin\phi(\frac{1}{2}m_{s}+m_{b})}{d\sin\theta}$$

- there is, in fact, still bullshit going on at the pin
- you can solve for it by breaking the force into horizontal and vertical components and just doing sum of the forces is 0, but you can't put further names on them than the $x$ and $y$ components, because there's some shenanigans afoot
