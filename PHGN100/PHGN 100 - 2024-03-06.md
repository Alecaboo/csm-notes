### rolling
###### (of perfectly rigid bodies on perfectly rigid surfaces without slipping)

so generally, when a wheel moves..
- the whole thing generally translates in a direction, at the velocity of the center of mass 
	- (the entire wheel moves at this velocity)
- If it rolls to get there, there's also a torque and some rotating shenanigans going on
	- magnitude is the same, direction is perpendicularish
to get the rolling whatever, you add translational and rotational
- which makes the top 2x the translational velocity
- the bottom 0
- and the sides at weird directions

- when we've got rolling without slipping, we have static friction
	- which means the value isn't just $\mu*N,$ it's going to be some N2L based shenanigans
Quick equations
$$x_{cm}= R\theta_{cm}$$
$$v_{cm}= R\omega_{cm}$$
$$a_{cm}= R\alpha_{cm}$$
cm is about the center of mass



For some rolling object, with $$I_{\text{round object}}=c MR^{2}$$
Determining which rolling object is going to win, let's use our newton's second lawys

$$\sum\limits_{j}\vec{F}_{jb}=m_b\vec{a}_{b,cm}$$
$$x= m_{b}g\sin(\theta)-f_{s,pb}=m_{b}a_{b,cm}$$
and that's our translational sum, now for our rotational sum
$$\sum\limits_{j}\vec\tau_{F_{jb}}=I_{b}\vec{a}_{b}$$
$$AOR: f_{s,pb}R=I_{cm}\alpha _{b,cm}$$
Hey, we got three equations, three unknowns, we nee- **Third Equation**

$$a_{b,cm}=R\alpha_{b,cm}$$
That's the no slip condition

Combine them, and you get...

$$f_{s,pb}=\frac{I_{cm}a_{b,cm}}{R^2}$$
You can plug that into the other end, and you geeeet

$$m_{b}g\sin\theta - \frac{I_{cm}a_{b,cm}}{R^{2}}= m_{b}a_{b,cm}$$
You can solve for $a$ with a smidget of algebra bullshit

$$a_{b,cm}= \frac{m_{b}g\sin\theta}{m_{b}+ (I_{cm}/R^{2})}$$
You can plug moment of inertia in, and you get

$$a_{b,cm} = \frac{g\sin\theta}{1+c}$$
Note: wheel bullshit will just follow sum of the forces
