- today we're getting into potential energy
	- I definitely have *not* been using that for the last several weeks by instinct 
- Change in potential energy is defined as $$\Delta U_{\vec{F}_{int}}= - \int_{\vec{s}_{i}}^{\vec{s}_{f}}\vec{F}_{int}\cdot d\vec{s}$$
- the minus sign is hanging out from just balancing the equation - pops in from moving to the other side

- this darn thing is going to keep popping up
	- in physics, it's just a really fancy way of saying is that energy is neither created nor destroyed
	- in chemistry, it pops up in chemistry as the first law of thermodynamics
		- looks a little different, may have gotten a tad tipsy, but they've got the idea
- If the force is not conservative, that means no potential energy
