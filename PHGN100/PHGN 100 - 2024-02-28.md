## torque time
##### as a wise man once said, you torque me right round baby right round like a fulcrum baby right round right round

The larger the moment of inertia, the harder it is to get rotation


All translational motion has a rotational analog

| Translational                     | Rotational                               |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| External Forces act on the system | External forces create torque            |
| $\vec{F}_{ab}$                    | $\vec{\tau}_ab$                          |
| Mass, $m_{b}$                     | Moment of intertia, $I_{b}$              |
| Acceleration, $\vec{a}_{b}$       | Angular acceleration, $\vec{\alpha}_{b}$ |
| Sum of the forces                 | Sum of the torques                       |
| External forces shown on FBD                                  | Extended free body diagram (can no longer reduce objects to dots)                                         |
The physics department lost their sledgehammer

$\vec{\tau}_{F_{ab}}=\vec{r}\times\vec{F}_{ab}$ 
Also could be defined as $\tau=rF_{ab\perp}$ 
which is $\tau=\sin(\theta)rF_{ab}$
