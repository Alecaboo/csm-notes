## Real Physics Time
- Kinematics, don't care why things move, but we do care about *how* things move
- Equations
$$v_{x}(t) = \frac{dx(t)}{dt}$$
$$a_x(t)=\frac{d_v}{y}$$
- ok gotta go write those out more

- Speed vs velocity, speed tends to be just $v$, velocity is $\vec v$ or $v_x$ 

---

### example prob
- Acceleration is 5.7 m/s^3 (t), If $V_{o}t$ if 2.93 m/s, find velocity at $t_f$
- Velocity at final time is velocity at initial time + integral of acceleration from initial time to final time
$$v_{ix} + \int$$
Do some integration, $\frac{1}{2}ct^{2}$
$v_{ix}=\frac{1}{2}c(t_{f}^{2}-t_{i}^{2})$
25.73 m/s? Probably?


$$v_{x}(t)=v_{x}(t_{i})+\int_{t_i}^{t}a_{x}(t')dt'$$
So that works out to be just about the same

$=v_{ix} + \frac{1}{2}c(t^{2}-t_{i}^{2})$
