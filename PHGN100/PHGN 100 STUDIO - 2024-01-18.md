# 1-2 Graphical Treatment

### 2
Coordinates 1: Magnitude of x is 0, magnitude of y is -3, as the vector is pointing straight down, so we needed to change the direction

Coordinates 2:
$x=\sin(\theta)*v = 1.5$
$y=\cos(\theta)*v =-2.60$
Y has to be negative as we're pointing down


Coordinates 3:
So the vector would be $70\degree$ off the x axis, because we need to complete the triangle
(you could also just use 20 and swap sin and cos)
$x=\cos(\theta)*v =-1.03$
$y=\sin(\theta)*v=-2.82$
Both negative because directions

Coordinates 4:
$\vec V_{1}= 3\hat x + 1\hat y$ 
$\vec V_{2}= 1\hat x + 4\hat y$ 

$\vec v_{1}- \vec v_{2}= 2\hat{x}-3\hat{y}$

Magnitude would be $|\vec v_{1}- \vec v_{2}| = \sqrt{2^{2}+3^{2}}=\sqrt{13}$
Theta would be the arctan of our triangle formed, which in order to get relative to the x axis, we need $\frac{y}{x}$ , or $\tan^{-1}{\frac{-3}{2}}$ = -56.3$\degree$
