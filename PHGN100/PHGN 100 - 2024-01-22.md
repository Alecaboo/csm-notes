[[PHGN100 - Block One]]

- For 2d motion, we end up having vectors for $x$ and $y$, and most of the time, they don't interact 
- Bigger values of $v_{iy}$ will take longer to slow to zero with the same acceleration
- Velocity is samesies right after launch as it is right before we land
- Hit time would be $t_{hit}=\frac{2v_{1}\sin\theta}{g}$
- $t_{peak}=\frac{\text{y component}}{g}$
- Horizontal velocity is just the $\cos\theta*v_{i}$, which we just need to integrate with respect to time
	- So overall pos is just $x_{0}+\int_{0}^{t_{hit}}v_{x}(t)dt=0+\int_{0}^{t_{hit}}v_{1}\cos\theta dt$
- Hey, we could use the first derivative test to find the best angle to launch at
-


#### Funky question
- Airplane
$$a_{y}(t)=[\frac{v_{x}(t)}{v_{ix}}-1]\ \ a_{x}(t)=Bt$$
$$v_{x(t)}= v_{x}(0) + \int_{0}^{t} a_{x}(t')dt' = v_{ix}+ \frac{1}{2}Bt^{2}$$
- Oh hey look, we have 1/2 at^2 from algebra based physics

$$v_{y}(t)= v_{iy}+ \int_{0}^{t}(\frac{v_x(t')}{v_{ix}})$$
$$v_{iy}+ \int_{0}^{t}[ \frac{\frac{1}{2}Bt^{2}+v_{ix}}{v_{ix}}-1]$$
Oh hey rename 1 to $\frac{v_{ix}}{v_{ix}}$
$$v_{iy}+ \int_{0}^{t}[\frac{\frac{1}{2}Bt^{2}}{v_{ix}}]gdt'$$
Ugly ass integral. It's ugly. It's terrible.
