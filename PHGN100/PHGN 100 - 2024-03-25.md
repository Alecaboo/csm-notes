- Rotational kinetic energy just uses moment of inertia, and you use rotational speed ($\omega$)

$$W_{F_{YC}}= \int _{\theta_{i}}^{\theta^{f}}= \tau_{F_{YC}}d\theta$$
That torque is in fact just the radius times the force, since nothing else actually does anything

### quick summary of heat energy 
- this shit's fucked, we ain't got no idea
- you can only really tell when you set your system to aggressively make friction an internal force, and then just kinda think about it, and yeah, you'll share 10J
