1.3.4 Existing Solutions

 Electronic waste is a longstanding problem, and as such, there are a wide variety of already existing potential solutions. Within Colorado, Bluestar Recyling {REFERENCE} handles a large volume of commercial electronic waste, including LED televisions. However, Bluestar remains a largely commercial solution due to several issues, including pickup fees {REFERENCE} and other general transport difficulties. Additionally, average non-commerical consumers often face confusing regulations regarding what can and cannot be dumped or recycled - for instance, an existing "junk guy" at Lafayette Gardens, a low income park, can only take certain kinds of televisions - further complicating the issue of electronic waste{REFERENCE}. Throughout this stage of our research, we had potentially considered pursuing the recycling of PVC gift cards, a consumable good with effectively no existing solutions. Currently, PVC cards are shipped abroad and dumped in several countries, including Turkey, where they pollute the land with several deleterious side effects {REFERENCE}. The reason that this is the current best solution for gift cards is due to the incredibly harmful nature of PVC - burning, applying chemicals, or effectively any other form of processing releases harmful chemicals {REFERENCE}. While there are several alternatives to PVC, there are no effective solutions for recycling PVC, and we felt that attempting to invent an entirely new process would be beyond the scope of our abilities.
