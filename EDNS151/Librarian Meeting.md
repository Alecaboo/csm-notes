- We should really come up with a team name
#### Scholarly vs Authoritative
#### Scholarly
- Written by a *scholar*, typically with a phd in the subject
	- They do research, they say what they think is going on
		- Other scholars will check their work
#### Authoritative
- They know what they're talking about
- Example is a master plumber - they don't need a degree, but they know a lot about it

- Neil DeGrasse Tyson
	- He's the person to ask about space, but not running a daycare
- What experience does someone have that makes them an expert?

### Problem Stuff
- Your own experience can be super valid
	- If there's something in your own life that you find and say *make that better,* that's great
	- Doing research is going to change
- Notes on LED TV
	- We're going to find some potential solutions
	- At worst, we're just find people talking about the issue components
- We should probably look at the last 5 years of sources when searching the library
- Every record in the library catalog is going to have the Subject, which is a tag to mark different similar things
- Remember to format your bibliography properly
- This research is going to suck!
	- Librarians can help!
	- \
- Real world note:
	- You do not need to reinvent everything you touch - if you need to solve a problem with a couple things from home depot - do it
- Librarians will happily act as a reality check
	- Don't make 7km cables
	- Don't try and change behavior
		- Everyone is lazy and stupid
- The best teams show the entire system
	- Both the technical part and the system
		- You can reasonably also just pass that off to someone else
- The tighter the problem definition
- Note: how are we going to motivate people for our solution
- Trash days
	- E-trash days (Arvada) #toDo RESEARCH THAT
	- They filled trucks in a matter of hours that they expected to take weeks
- As a Judge
	- Big fan of practical testing
		- We should go rip a TV apart
	- Have a marketing strategy
- Low income rate reduction
	- Have a sliding scale, instead of a speicla service
