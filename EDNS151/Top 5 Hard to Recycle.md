#edns151 #design #upcycleeverything 
- Plastic gift cards 
	- Is there a way to reset it, reuse it, something of the kind?
		- Would anyone bother to go through doing that?
	- Recycling center has no idea what to do with them 
		- They can filter it out, but what to do then?
- Water filters
	- Brita filters, stuff like that
- Ugly food
	- They use denim packaging, but like, there's not a use for denim packaging
		- Art Parts in Boulder recycles it (through ecocycle) 
		- Other then them, its beiing wasted
- Curbside Plate Glass
	- What even is that?
		- Utah based glass recycling (with food on them?)
- Shipping Envelopes
	- The ones with bubble wrap in them
	- If you cannot reduce something back to its base components, you can't really recycle it
		- Those bubble wrap enveloeps
