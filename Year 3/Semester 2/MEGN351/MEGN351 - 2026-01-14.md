#### Reminders from Last Time
- When dealing with relatively consistent temperature fluids, we tend to treat them with uniform density.
## Bulk Modulus
- If you squeeze some volume of fluid from all sides, we squish this differential volume of fluid into a smaller space, the bulk modulus, $E_{v}$ is defined as $E_{v}=\frac{dn=\frac{dp}{A}}{-\frac{dv}{v}}$
	- Quick dimensional analysis check, we have pascals over a dimensionless number (since the bottom is just the % of how much it's shrunk), so it's the pressure we'd need to fully collapse the volume
- This value is, again, how much pressure you need to squish something, so it's pretty high for solids, decently high for liquids, and pretty small for gasses
	- $p=\rho RT$
- This is a p.

### Example
- An amount of glycerin has a volume of 1m^3 when the pressure is 120 kPa. If the pressure is increased to 400 kPa, determine the change in volume of this cubic meter. The bulk modulus for glycerin is $E_{v}=4.52 GPa$
$$
4520\text{ MPa}= \frac{ 280\text{kPa}}{\frac{v_{2}-v_{1}}{v_{1}}}
$$
$$
4520 \text{ MPa}= \frac{0.280 \text{ MPa}}{(v_{2}-1)}
$$
$$
4520v_{2} -4520 = 0.280
$$
We get a final answer of $6.19*10^{-5}$ for change in volume, which mentally sounds a little small for 4x pressure but then you realize the bulk modulus is in GPa and it makes sense (also the whole liquids being more or less incompressible)

## Back to adventures in Viscosity
- $v(y=0)=0$ is the no slip condition set up mathematically
- Fluid has some temperature profile, which we often approximate as linear, but like a fully developed turbulent flow pipe
- We still have our disc-y layers with our thing floating on top that we're applying force to
- $\tau=\frac{\Delta\theta}{\Delta T}$ which is the change in angle
- $\tan \theta=\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta y}$
- Velocity is just $\frac{dx}{dt}$
- Newton's Law of Viscosity is $\tau=\frac{\mu du}{dy}$
