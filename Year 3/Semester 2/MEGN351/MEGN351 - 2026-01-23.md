## Hydrostatics
- When dealing with hydrostatics, you've got two key assumptions: it's inviscous, meaning $\mu \approx 0$, and incompressible, meaning $\rho=\text{constant}$ 
- Pascal's Law is our old friend here, meaning that $P=\frac{F}{A}$
- Enclosed fluids are essentially instantly transmitted as far as we're concerned

$$
w_{2}=F_{2}d_{2}=F_{1} \frac{*A_{2}}{A_{1}}*d_{2}
$$
