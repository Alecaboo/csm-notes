### "We're probably not going to get into fluids today"
- Let the record show at 12:10, "let's start talking about some of the properties of fluids"

### Differences between Solids and Fluids and Such
- If you were to apply force to a (fixed) solid, you'd expect deformation
- Let's say, somehow, we have some fluid on a surface, probably sitting in a pipe, and we're going to have what we call the no-slip condition, 
- Angle of deformation of a fluid is going to be a function of a force, and is going to be roughly linear over time

### Unit Shenanigans
- Force is newtons, a is m/s$^{2}$, mass is kg, our homeboy here is European so he really prefers SI units. Awesome (said without sarcasm, this is hype).

### Stress and Such
- Shear Stress is often $\tau$, is $\frac{dFs}{dA}$, which is shear force over area, and is units of N/m^2 
- You're never going to believe this, but normal stress is $\frac{dFn}{dA}$, or normal force over area, and uses $\sigma_{n}$ 

---

### Some kinda example shenanigans
- We have some disk on oil, and a disk on water
- Same force applied to each, so same stress
- You're expecting a greater angle of deformation in the layers of water compared to the oil due to oil having a higher viscosity, 
- Newton's Law of Viscosity is something to the effect of $\tau=\mu\frac{ d\theta}{dt}$
	- We're also planning on rearranging that to be out of angle hell because it's actually kind of just awful to work with angles.
### Properties of Fluids
- Obligatory note, big V is volume, little v is velocity
- Our density, $\rho$, is $\frac{m}{V}=\frac{kg}{m^{3}}$
	- There's the fuckass $n=\rho RT$, because we like our gas law with density as a straight up component
- Fluids have a specific weight, which is the force per unit mass, weight of something is mg, specific is specific to the volume
	- $\gamma=\frac{mg}{V}=\rho g$
		- Units on those are the fuckass dimensional analysis, or just N/m^3 
- Specific Gravity
	- SG = $\frac{\rho}{\rho_{w}}$
	- Which, for fluids, is just comparing how dense something is relative to water.
		- Also, $\rho_{water}=1000$ because SI units are awesome, so it's really easy to use this as a percentage and just convert around all willy-nilly.
	- For gasses we're comparing to just atmospheric air as our baseline.
