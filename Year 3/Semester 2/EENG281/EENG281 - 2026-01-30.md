## Mesh Currents
- Meshes are loops that contain no other loops
- Meshes only exist in the perimeter of the loop
- An essential branch is a path which connects two essential nodes without passing through another essential node
- 'From where you enter, take the sign with you' is actually a fantastic phrase to sum it up
- Meshin it:
	- Mesh A: $-40+2(i_{a})+8(i_{a}-i_{b})$
	- Mesh B: $6i_{b}+6(i_{b}-i_{c})+8(i_{b}-i_{a})$
	- Mesh C: $4i_{c}+20+6(i_{c}-i_{b})$
