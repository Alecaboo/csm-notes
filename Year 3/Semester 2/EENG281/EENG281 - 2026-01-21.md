## Kirchhoff's Voltage Law
- Kirchhoff's Voltage Law is the law o' loops, which says that the voltage around a loop equals zero.
	- Really astonishing shit coming out of Kirchhoff saying that shit has to balance. I hate it here.
### You're actually never gonna believe this shit (Kirchhoff's Current Law)
- The current going *in* the node is the same as the current *out* the node.

### Equivalence
- The equivalent resistance of a whole nasty wicket of things is just the equivalent voltage, $v_{s}$ divided by the equivalent current, $i_{s}$
- So, this works out that

$$
\frac{V_{s}}{R_{eq}}=\frac{V_{1}}{R_{1}}+\frac{V_{2}}{R_{2}}
$$
- This is for like two resistors in parallel ^
- This comes from the basic equation for resistors in parallel, which is that
$$
\frac{1}{R_{eq}}=\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}
$$
- Obligatory side note is that there's a cute little shortcut equation for *JUST TWO RESISTORS* of 
$$
\frac{R_{1}R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}
$$
## Dealing with Resistors in Series
- Elements in series have the same current, so if you were to go put KCL to the test, you'd end up with like $i_{s}=i_{1}=i_{2}=i_{3}=i_{4}\dots=i_{n}$
- Kirchhoff's *Voltage* Law, however, gives us notably more interesting implications, that being $v_{s}=i_{s}(R_{1}+R_{2}+R_{n})$
- Also, again, resistors in series are just $R_{1}+R_{2}+R_{3}=R_{eq}$
