## The Wheatstone Bridge Fucker
- You put three resistors in a diamond with a fourth unknown completing the diamond, stick a galvanometer (current reader) in the middle, and you can figure out the unknown by balancing it around a current of zero. (One of your knowns is a variable resistor {potentiometer}, so you can use that to fine tune)
- Future alec, stick the old drawing in here.

### Delta-Wye Transformations
- Converting from triangles to Y shapes and back and forth and such
- I was unfortunately tragically locked in on crossplay and didn't write down equations
-
