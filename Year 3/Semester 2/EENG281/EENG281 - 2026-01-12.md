### This is going to be a long class.
- I am at peace. I am at peace. I am at peace. I am at peace. I am at peace. I am at peace. I am at peace. I am at peace. I am at peace. I am at peace. I am at peace. 
	- Just for posterity's sake, this man's projection is worse than the Little Women cast.
		- hey woah woah not cool- wren
		- no no that's accurate - greer
- H EFIGURED OUT HOW TO GET ANOTHER DECIBEL jesus i can't type LETS GO

### Lecture-y Lecture
- Balancing power is a great way of checking your answer - it should be zero. If it's not zero, you've fucked up, and you gotta figure out where.
	- Sign convention, negative means something is providing power, positive means it's taking power 
		- I hate this class's sign convention
	- Once we know how Phys 2 works, you can use Ohm and Kirchoff to find power and current and resistance and all that good stuff, then plug that around to power to see if things work out

- Obligatory note that the charge on an electron is 1.6022*10^-19
- Default assumption is that current flows from positive to negative, but you can go swapsies all you want. But be familiar with both, they do just deadass ask convention based questions on the exam.

- Voltage is the energy created per unit charge of separation, so you can express that as $v=\frac{dw}{dq}$, where v is the voltage in volts, w is the energy in joules, and q is the charge in coulombs.
