## Voltage Divider
- You have two resistors in series, with resistance R1 and R2, they each get some portion of the voltage
$$
v_{1}=\frac{R_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}v_{s}, v_{2}=\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}v_{s}
$$
$$
i_{s}=\frac{v_{s}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}
$$
$$
v_{1}=i_{s}R_{1}
$$
## Current Divider
- You have two resistors in parallel, with resistance R1 and R2, they each get some portio of the current
$$
i_{1}=\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}i_{s}, i_{2}=\frac{R_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}i_{s}
$$

4/6 -> 2.4 ohm
1.6+2.4 -> 4
3.2 ohm total resistance (this was for fun)

$$
i_{o}=\frac{16}{16+4}(10)=8A
$$
4.8A actually going through our 4ohm friend
$$
V=iR, V = 19.2, P = \frac{V^{2}}{R} = Vi =92.2
