- Follow the canvas course, it tells you basically everything
- Project Lead is main point of contact with Aly - she greatly prefers having 60 contacts vs 180+, feel free to delegate but they should be main manager person
- Digital media coordinator is finding visual elements to use throughout the campaign, etc, etc
- Marketing and outreach coordinators are... doing outreach. Crazy, I know

### Project Phases
- Today we're talking about phase one, which is pre-campaign stuff
- Timeline can be found under the syllabus in the canvas course 
	- Goal is all of our phase 1 (pre-launch) materials by the end of the upcoming weekend, and over fall break our campaigns will be getting built
- There's going to be a hard launch/kickstart type beat the week after that fall break
- "Why do campaigns close Dec 2nd?"
	- Campaigns deliberately close on Giving Tuesday for punchiness there
- The goldmine website we're making will technically never go away, and we could theoretically send it out all year long
- On the goldmine website there's the "projects" tab, which is where you'll be able to 'find' various projects, but if we give someone a direct link it'll work
- for us - we're going to be refreshing and updating priorities, but the general vibe is going to be the same of our page
- Modules on canvas has all of the good details
- There's a template in each assignment with Word doc templates, **use those so she can conveniently copy paste**
	- The application should have most of the goodies already
- Gotta come up with a good punchy one sentence summary of who we are and what we're fundraising
- Probably going to rewrite for the MLT page, but, w/e
- https://weare.mines.edu/s/840/bp23/project.aspx?sid=840&gid=1&pgid=8296
- We need a really good picture for the tile - might be the logo, but it's going to be the picture on the goldmine big tile layout, the embed on social media, fucking everywhere
	- Basically, the photos get sprinkled throughout and they say really well what they do and what they're for. Assemble the word doc in a way that makes sense and she'll do her best to copy over
- Video is optional, if we're interested and we strategically use it in marketing we can do that
- We'll get a link with our page being live sometime around the 22nd, and we can look it over
- Phase 2 launch parties get hosted by Foundation to get our whole org doin stuff
	- There are perks! We get $100 of bonus gift if we reach the donor goal the night of the launch party, and we'll get fed
	- The launch parties are Monday/Tuesday of Showcase tech week, which is just delightful.
		- Plug goldmine during showcase?
		- RSVP deadline is the 17th for launch party if we're sending a subteam over there.
- Agenda for phase 2 meetings:
	- Touch base on website, should be close to being built/done
	- We'll jump into launch party planning, if we're not submitting RSVP beforehand be locked and ready to submit post meeting
		- We'll then get into the phase 2 stuff in canvas
