### Depreciation Methods Under the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS, 1986 Tax Reform)
- I really just wanted to write out that full title
- Straight Line
- Declining Balance
	- We're going to talk about it, but that's actually illegal
- Declining Balance Switching to Straight Line
- Units of Production
---
#### Depreciation Conventions
- Half year convention on all personal property, assumes you've had it for a while
	- If you try and get cute and game the system, you get smacked with mid quarter conventions.
- Real Property (Buildings)
	- Mid Month convention based on when it goes into service, half the month it goes into service + the rest of the year
- Straight Line Depreciation
	- Is how much you paid divided by 1/n, where n is the allowable depreciation life as determined by congress 
	- Example
	- Assume you purchased a new machine for 100,000 in January of a tax year that corresponds to a calendar year, assume it's placed into service in August of the same year, ~~*the estimated life is eight years when salvage value is estimated to be $30,000*~~  don't care about any of that, tax code don't give a fuck
	- Assume the machine is in 5 year depreciation life and that half year convention is applicable

| Year      |                   |     |
| --------- | ----------------- | --- |
| Years 1   | 100,000(1/5)(1/2) |     |
| Years 2-5 | 100,000(1/5)      |     |
| Year 6    | 100,000(1/5)(1/2) |     |

Next week's homework example

Steel Building Cost of $800,000
Commercial Building with a 39 year life
Convention is mid month, starting in August

### Declining Balance
- Declining Balance is multiplied by an "adjusted basis"
- Adjusted basis is cost - cumulative depreciation previously taken
	- This is sometimes called a book value
- This is illegal because the math is a pain so I stopped writing it all down. Womp womp.

#### MACRS
- p370 in textbook
- Build a MACRS Depreciation
- Vehicle Cost is $60,000
- 5 year life, 1/2 year convention

---
### Depletion

$$
\text{(Adjusted Basis, \$) } * \frac{\text{Mineral units removed and sold during the year}}{\text{Mineral Units recoverable at the beginning of the year}}
$$
