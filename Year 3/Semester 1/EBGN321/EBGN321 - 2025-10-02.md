## Personal Service Assignment Housekeeping
- It exists. I forgor to write notes. Anyways

### Excel Shackles are off, go crazy

## Mutually Exclusive Options
- You can only choose *one* of the options
- We need some kind of process to compare these things
	- Wwe can build what's called an incremental
		- Compare initial investments, and take the larger investment minus the smaller investment

| 0    | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |           |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --------- |
| -100 | 30  | 30  | 30  | 30  | 130 | Project A |
| -300 | 60  | 60  | 60  | 60  | 360 | Project B |
| -200 | 30  | 30  | 30  | 30  | 230 |           |
- We can calculate the incremental rate of return, which would spit out fifteen percent here - which means we should accept B over A, because the incremental rate of return is better
	- Incremental gives you an answer that says "choose one of these," there is no "reject this out of hand" option anymore.
- Your first mandatory step is check if you need to reject *both* proposals
- To get a rate of return, we need an incremental
	- We can never compare project rate of returns head to head
- So hold on, why in the hell are we not just subtracting NPVs straight across and calling that a day?
	- Great question! Eat shit. See you next week.
- For ratios and GROR, you need an incremental. For everything in this entire unit, go do an incremental.
