### Examples
- Looking to lease a subaru forester, you found a 36 month closed-end lease, with an MSRP of $25,270, and a lease end of purchase value of $15,667. To get the lease you have to pay 1765 as a fee, and the monthly payment was calculated as 265 buckaroos.

| -25270<br>1765<br>265 | 265 |     | 265 |  (15667) |
| --------------------- | --- | --- | --- | -------- |
| 0                     | 1   | ... | 35  | 36       |
- What is the nominal rate of return for the dealer?
	- First up we gotta find the APR (fee inclusive)
	- PW eq = 0 -23240 +265(P/A<sub>i,35</sub>) + 15,667 (P/F<sub>i,36</sub>)
		- Not asked to show interpolation, so we can just find that i is 0.2426 % / month, and we get 2.91% per year as our apr
- What would the lease payment be if the dealer wants a 6% interest rate compounded monthly?
	- We get that i=0.5%
	- Solving for A, we have A = -252750(A/P<sub>0.5%,36</sub>) + 15667(A/F<sub>0.5%,36</sub>)
		- This gets us A values for 1-36 of 370.78, multiply by (P/F<sub>0.5%,1</sub>), getting us 368.92
- Question 4 on the test is, again, going to be showing interpolation on rate of return

A couple of friends want to start a brewery after graduating. To raise the cash  
they needed to start the business they found a small business loan with the  
following terms. The loan has a 5-year term, and a nominal rate of 7%. The  
payment plan is unique, you will owe $22,650.16 all five years AND you will also  
have to pay a balloon payment in year 5 of $10,000. Cash Flows are listed  
below for this loan.  

If they had to pay a fee, what would the rate be?
Setting up PW Equation, we get 
0 = -100,000 + 5,500 + 22650(P/A<sub>i,5</sub>) + 10,000(P/F<sub>i,5</sub>)
- Spits out an interest rate of 9.03%

- How much interest will accrue in the third year of the loan?


| -100,000 | 22,650 | 22,650 | 22,650 | 22,650 | 22,650+10,000 |
| -------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------------- |
| 0        | 1      | 2      | 3      | 4      | 5             |
- We're looking for the PV at the end of time period two
P = 22,650(P/A<sub>7%,3</sub>) + 10,000(P/F<sub>7%,3</sub>)
Spits out a present value of 67,604, multiplied by our interest rate of 0.07% and we get 4,732 of interest

----
- You get 100,000 inherited from a relative
	- r/m gives you i 0.009/365, and our effective rate is going to be E = (1+i)^m -1
		- Spits out an effective rate of .904%
	- You go invest in the russell 2000, 30 years, 12% interest, compounded annually, 100,000 in year 0, it's literally just 100,000 (F/P<sub>12%,30</sub>) which gives you a value of 2,995,992
	- After 30 years you buy a structured annuity, so we're now using the number we have, sticking it in as an A value with an interest rate of 4%, so looking at A values in 1-45
		- 2,995,992 (A/P<sub>4%,45</sub>) gives us a value of $144,594

- Now for the fun part

Working entirely in thousands because that just chops off zeroes, i* of 12% given the problem state

| Year                                                | 0             | 1            | 2           | 3           | 4           | 5           |

| BTCF                                                | -110          | -40          | 38          | 40          | 40          | 42          |
PW equation is 0 = -110 -40(P/F<sub>i,1</sub>) + 38(P/F<sub>i,2</sub>) + 40 (P/A<sub>i,2</sub>)(P/F<sub>i,2</sub>) + 42(P/F<sub>i,5</sub>), 
NPV @12% = -3750, no
Rate of return, show interpolation
@12% we get -37
running at 0% we get 10

= 0 + 12%( $\frac{10-0}{(10-37)}$)which spits out 2.5% which is less than 12% so :(

PVR

Which is NPV/(PW Costs)

The phrase "PW Costs" is just negative total cash flows, not all the negative spots, do *everything* based on cash flows and not the individual bits and bobs themselves

- Which gives us $\frac{-37}{-110-40(P/F_{12\%,1})}$
- GROR
1. Determine FWOW Profit, which is the FV in year 5 of our profits (positive cash flows)
	1. Fv<sub>5</sub> = 38(F/P<sub>12%,3</sub>) + 40(F/A<sub>12%,2</sub>)(F/P<sub>12%,1</sub>)+42 = 190
2. That goes into our future worth at 5, new table

| -110 | -40 | -   | -   | -   | 190 |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0    | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
- And then we're solving our PW equation for 0, so we have -110 - 40(P/F<sub>i,1</sub>) + 190(P/F<sub>i,5</sub>)
