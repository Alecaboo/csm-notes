### Review Notes (Just going to write it back out for convenient review's sake)
1. Spend $1, get $1 worth of deductions now or later
2. $1 worth of deductions saves $0.25 in tax
3. Capital costs show up 3 times
	1. Charge to capital
	2. Deduction
	3. Add back
4. Cumulative net income = cumulative after tax cash flow
---
- Expense = Take deduction
- Capitalize = take deduction
	- -> add backs
- Tangible assets -> Depreciate
- Intangible assets -> Amortize
	- Amortization is basically just straight line depreciation, and it works well enough for engineering
- Wasting Assets -> Depletion

---
#### Depreciable if
1. Used in business
2. Life longer than 1 year
	1. Becomes an operating cost otherwise
3. Wears/out/decays/gets used up
	1. Becomes a write off 
4. Put in service
- Examples
	- Buildings - depreciable, but you can only use SL depreciation, which has a 39 year life 
	- Land - Write off when you sell it 
	- Equipment - depreciable, use MACRS
	- Software - Intangible, amortize it
		- Could also be an expense, depending on lifetime
	- Gold ore - depletion, we'll talk about it
- Working capital is inventory, and you can deduct it when you sell it - whether to customers or if you just sell your whole damn business
#### Conventions
- Personal property -> 1/2 year
- Buildings use mid month convention

## Marijuana and the Magical Power of Taxes
- Honestly I just wanted that as a section header, I'm not going to take notes on it.
