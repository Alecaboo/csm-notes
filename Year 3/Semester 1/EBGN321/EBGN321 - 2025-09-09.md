### Questions & Clarifications
- Obligatory reminder that we're going to have a face value on all of our bonds of $1000 for simplicity's sake
- 
## Loans and Payments, Oh My!
- Drop a $10,000 loan today, and we promise to repay $2,638 every year for five years.
- Be ready for flipped perspectives on the exam of like cost to bank / return to you, etc
- What's the rate of return on that loan?
- PW is going to be -10,000 + 2638(P/A$_{i,5}$)
- Approximate i is going to be average income / cumulative investment
	- ***IF*** you have 8-10 years of average cash flows
- So $\frac{2638}{10000}$ is going to be approximately 26%, chop that in half because the years are off, 13%
	- If we call it 12%, we're off by like -490, so we're going to need to dunk the interest rates a bit to increase the value
	- Running it at like 10% we get around 0, well shit, we found it
- So there's our rate of return, around 10%
- Hold on, how the hell did we get 2638 in the first place?
	- That was just 10,000 * (A/P<sub>10%,5</sub>)=2638

| Year | Beginning Bal | PMT     | i-PMT  | Principal Payment | End Balance |
| ---- | ------------- | ------- | ------ | ----------------- | ----------- |
| 1    | 10,000        | 2,638 = | (1000+ | 1,638)            | 8,362       |
| 2    | 8,362         | 2,638   | 836    | 1802              | 6560        |
| 3    | 6560          | 2,638   | 656    | 1982              | 4578        |
| 4    | 4578          | 2,638   | 458    | 2180              | 2398        |
| 5    | 2398          | 2,638   | 240    | 2398              | 0           |
- That original gut reaction of "interest should be 10% on 10,000, $1000!" is a thing that exists, and it's known as a flat/addon/simple interest 
	- in this case, taking flat would be an idiot's move, and you'd have to get down to a flat rate of like 6.4% before it makes any sense to take the flat rate.
- Flat interest is NOT allowed on home loans, for consumer protection reasons. Neat.
- Flat interest can be really good on something like student loans where you *don't pay it right away*

### Investment
- Tim Taylor the Toolman works for All-Pro Capital
- If we give Timmy boy $15,000 and $25,000 next year, he promises to pay us $20,000 in years two through five.
	- Tim makes mildly shady envelope deals on the side of Federal. Don't worry about it.
- We're going to make an assumption on what we're going to call i$^*$, our minimum rate of return, which we're going to call 20%
- So let's get calculating by doing a PW equation and solving equal to zero
	- 0 = -15,000 - 25,000(P/F,1) + 20,000(P/A, 4)(P/F,1)
		- Let's run the numbers at 25%, we get 2,786, so let's bump it up
		- Run it at 30, we get -904, shit, overshot, we're somewhere in the. middle
		- 25 + 5 ($\frac{2786}{2786-904}$), which spits out 28.7% as our rate of return from Tim "The Toolman" Taylor
- Ok, hold on, how much money are we making on this?**(ùêì)**
- NPV is -15000 - 25000(P/F,20%) + 20,000(P/A,20%,4)(P/F,20%,1)
	- Spits out $7,312
### Ratios
- Ratios measure value per dollar invested
- The Present Value Ratio, or PVR
	- is NPV@i* divided by | PW of Costs|
	- Which, for instance here, would be $\frac{7312}{15000-25000\left( \frac{p}{f,20} \right)}$
		- Which spits out 0.20, which is greater than 0.0, so yeah, we rollin with it
- The Benefit Cost Ratio
	- is PW of Positive Cash Flows / |PW of Negative Cash Flows|
	- Which would spit out 1.20, which is greater than other options at 1.0 (no net return), so yeah, we rolling it
