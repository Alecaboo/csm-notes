## Housekeeping Things
- Ventzi Karaivanov 
- No grade calculator is definitely a choice of all time.
- I lowkey zoned out because we honest to god just read the syllabus the whole time.
- There's some equation, which is $v=\frac{wL^{3}}{368*EI}$
	- where $L$ is the length of the shelf, $w$ is the load, $E$ is the stiffness of the material, 368 is just some constant thing that's probably not actually 368, $I$ is the moment of intertia of the shelf (rectangle.)
		- Basically, there's all kinds of levers you can pull for how you design something.
- Types of Failure:
	- Elastic (recoverable deflection)
	- Plastic (non-recoverable deflection)
	- Fracture (shit's broken.)
- Mechanics has equivalent of fuses in lots of bolts, which are often designed to break before expensive components.
- We're really just dealing with simple loading or deformations, and eventually we'll start smacking different varieties of deformation together and call it a good time.
- Mechanics relies on the fundamental idea that you could chunk the shit out of something and make it into a bunch of finite elements (roll credits for megn324), which then makes it possible to actually do math.
