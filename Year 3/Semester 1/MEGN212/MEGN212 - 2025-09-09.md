### Chopping Bars at Angles
- Cross section is going to become $\frac{A}{\cos(\theta)}$ instead of just straight A
	- (same thickness but varying edge length)
- Average stress is still $\sigma_{avg}=\frac{P}{A}$, except
- Normal force
$$
\sigma_{\theta}=\frac{N}{A_{\theta}}=\frac{P\cos(\theta)}{\frac{A}{\cos(\theta)}}=\frac{P}{A}\cos ^{2}(\theta)=\frac{P}{2A}[1+\cos(2\theta)]
$$
$$
\tau_{\theta}=\frac{V}{A_{\theta}}=\frac{-P\sin(\theta)}{\frac{A}{\cos(\theta)}}=-\frac{P}{A}\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)=\frac{-P}{2A}\sin(2\theta)
$$
- The negative signs floating around are because we defined the $x'$ axis as being out of the cut, and the $y'$ axis as being along the cut. With no assigned coordinate system, shear doesn't carry a sign
- 45 degrees is the absolute maximum for shear stress in an axially loaded beam - it is NOT ZERO. DON'T FALL FOR THAT BAIT.
----
- Given a solid block, with:
	- F = -180 kip
	- A = 36 in^2
	- $\theta$ = 30 degrees
- Assuming that:
	- System is in equilibrium
	- Only axial loads
	- Bar is prismatic
- Finding:
	- Normal stress
	- Shear stress on the inclined plane

$$
\sum F_{y}=0, -180 +P = 0
$$
$$
V=P*\cos(30)=155.98\text{ kip}
$$
$$
N=P*\sin(30)=90 \text{ kip }
$$
- Inclined plane shenanigans!
$$
A_{30}=\frac{A}{\sin(30)}=72 in^{2}
$$
$$
\sigma_{30}=\frac{N}{A_{30}}=\frac{-90 kips}{72 \ in^{2}}=1.25 \text{ ksi}
$$
$$
\tau_{30}=\frac{V}{A_{30}}=\frac{155.98}{72}=2.17 \text{ ksi}
$$

### General Equations of Plane Stress Transformations
- Plane stresses are two normal stresses and one shear stress
- There's a lot of mildly fucked up triangle shenanigans you can do to derive these equations
$$
\sigma_{x}=\frac{\sigma_{x}+\sigma_{y}}{2}+ \frac{\sigma_{x}-\sigma_{y}}{2}\cos(2\theta)+\tau_{xy}\sin(2\theta)
$$
$$
\sigma_{y}=\frac{\sigma_{x}+\sigma_{y}}{2}-\frac{\sigma_{x}-\sigma_{y}}{2}\cos(2\theta)-\tau_{xy}\sin(2\theta)
$$
$$
\tau_{x'y'}= \frac{-\sigma_{x}-\sigma_{y}}{2}\sin(2\theta)+\tau_{xy}\cos(2\theta)
$$
- When you write out a whole bunch of equilibrium with a section view, you can do a sum of forces in all the directions with all the stresses, and you get out those equations I wrote down above. dw too much about how it's derived, but you can if you want to
- These are on the equation sheet! You don't have to worry!
- Defining counterclockwise rotation as a positive angle
- Trig identities are a thing that exists - double angles are generally the more convenient way to work with everything, but sometimes people use $\sin ^{2}$ or what have you 
----
- We have some stress element with -5.6 ksi $\sigma_{x}$, $11.2 \ \sigma_{y}$, and a $\tau_{xy}$ of 6.7 ksi.
	- If we set y' along our plane of interest ($\theta$ of 65 degrees), so then the angle between the x' and the horizontal is then going to be 25 degrees.
- So if we're looking for $\sigma_{x'}$, the equation for that is then going to be way up there
$$
\sigma_{x'}=\frac{\sigma_{x}+\sigma_{y}}{2}+ \frac{\sigma_{x}-\sigma_{y}}{2}\cos(2\theta)+\tau_{xy}\sin(2\theta)
$$
$$
\sigma_{x'} = \frac{-5.6+11.2}{2} + \frac{-5.6 - 11.2}{2}\cos(-50)-6.7\sin(-50)=2.53 \text{ ksi}
$$
$$
\tau_{x'y'}=-10.74 \text{ ksi}
$$
$$
\sigma_{y'}=3.067
$$
- So that's working with a $\theta$ of 25, which is if you set y' to be along the axis
- If you instead set x' to be along the axis, you're then working with a $\theta$ of 65, not -25, and then you're going to flipsies the signs & values on most of your things, ie, $\sigma_{x'}$ becomes 3.067 ksi, $\tau_{x'y'}$ becomes 10.74 ksi, and $\sigma_{y'}$ becomes 2.53 ksi
	- He decided to make these $\sigma''$, but I'm way too lazy to go edit all tjose.
