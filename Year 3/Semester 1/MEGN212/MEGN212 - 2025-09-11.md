## Bearing & Loading Stresses
- Lots of failure talk, but related note is your pin should be farther than 1 diameter from the edge so you don't just start ripping your plates to shreds.
- You can use whichever the fuck plate you want to figure out when bolts are gonna fail. The FBD turns out to be the same.
	- Said FBD is comically simple, where shear is equal to the applied force
		- There's theoretically a moment being generated from the thickness and the offset there, but the plates are generally thin enough that that's irrelevant 
- Shockingly, if you simulate something and get an actual software value, it's generally different than the average value - which is why we love to slap a safety factor on things and call it a day.
- Adding another plate and making a double shear connection splits your force in half. Again, exploding head emoji.
	- What do you do if you have more than two? Go make an FBD! Don't overcomplicate it!
		- "Pretty please draw an FBD" - Ventzi
- How do we go about calculating bearing stress? It's actually not *that* bad $$
\sigma_{B}=\frac{P}{A}=\frac{P}{td}
$$
- Where $t$ is the thickness of the plate and $d$ is the bolt diameter
	- We are NOT using the semicylindrical top of the bolt as the area - we're using the projected area of the inside rectangular bit of the cylinder
- Simulation example for bearing stress
	- Calculated was 3570 psi
	- Highest value probed was 6121 psi
	- Actual average was ~3450
$$
\tau = \frac{P}{A_{tearout}}
$$
$$
A_{tearout}=2*(L_{tear}*\text{thickness})
$$
$$
L_{tear}=X-r
$$
- Where $X$ is the distance from center of bolt/pin to the edge, and $r$ is the radius of said bolt/pin

 - The frame is subject to a 4kN load which acts on ABD, determine the required diameter of the pin at C if the allowable shear stress is $\tau_{allow}=40MPa$, pin C is subjected to double shear, round the result to the nearest mm
![[MEGN212 - 2025-09-11 2025-09-11 10.21.37.excalidraw]]
- If we go take the moment about $A$, we get
$$
\sum M_{A}=0 = -E_{y}(2.5)+4kn\cos(45)(3m)
$$
$$
E_{y}= \frac{4*\cos(45)*3)}{2.5}=3.394 \text{ kN}
$$
- Now you could just go about doing a free body diagram of ECD, for funsises
![[MEGN212 - 2025-09-11 2025-09-11 10.25.25.excalidraw]]
- If you go have fun with sum of moments about D
$$
\sum M_{D}=0=-3.394*(2.5m)-CB\sin(45)(1.5)
$$
$$
CB=-\frac{3.394(2.5)}{\sin(45)(1.5)}= -8 \text{kN}
$$
![[MEGN212 - 2025-09-11 2025-09-11 10.32.17.excalidraw]]
- We're in double shear with an 8kN force, so V is just going to be 4 kN
$$
\tau_{allow}=\frac{V}{A}=\frac{V}{\frac{\pi}{4}d^{2}}
$$
$$
d=\sqrt{ \frac{4*V}{\pi*\tau_{allow}} } = \sqrt{ \frac{4*4*10^3}{\pi*40* \frac{N}{mm^{2}}} } = 11.3 \text{ mm}
$$
- Answer there is 12mm, because you go to the closest measurement that works.
	- Would 11 probably work? Sure. We have a safety factor on it. It'd probably be fine. But go to twelve.
- Alright, working the same setup
	- Pin D is subjected to single shear, assume $D_{x}=5.657 \ kN$ and $D_{y}=2.263 \ kN$, Determine the required diameter of the pin at D assuming the same allowable stress of 40 MPa
		- So just right off the bat, you have to find your actual shear, which is going to be $\sqrt{ D_{x}^{2}+D_{y}^{2} }=6.093$ kN, neato, holly dee
		- And then it's going to be essentially the same setup, except
$$
d = \sqrt{ \frac{4*V}{\pi*\tau_{allow}} }=\sqrt{ \frac{4(6.093*10^3)}{\pi*40} }=13.93\text{ mm}
$$
- Which is fourteen millimeters
![[MEGN212 - 2025-09-11 2025-09-11 10.42.37.excalidraw]]
- Alright, sure, 405 kN/m, which is then 135 kN at plate B
-$$
\sigma_{B}=\frac{B_{y}}{b^{2}}, \frac{135*10^3}{1.5 \frac{N}{mm^{2}}} = b^{2}, b = 300 \text{ mm}
$$
