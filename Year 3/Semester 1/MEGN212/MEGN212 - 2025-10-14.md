#### Sign convention for torsional loading
- Positive if your right hand thumb is outward from the shaft
- Phi $\phi$ is angle of twist

$$
\gamma_{c}=\frac{c\phi}{L}, G = \frac{\tau}{\delta}
$$
$$
G=\frac{\frac{Tc}{j}}{\frac{c\phi}{L}}=\frac{TcL}{c\phi j}=\frac{TL}{\phi j}, \phi= \frac{TL}{GJ}
$$
- Where:
	- T is internal torque
	- L is angle
	- G is shear modulus
	- J is polar moment of intertia

- Example, except I'm sleepy and don't wannaâ„¢
	- Big ol' 4in diameter cylinder, 4.8in long, attached to a 2in diameter cylinder 2.4 in long
	- Big one is fixed to a wall, 9000 lbf\*ft load acting clockwise on the end of it, and 2668 lbf\*ft ccw load on the end of the little one
	- Internal torque on the little one is 2668 lbf \* ft, positive internal torque
	- For the big one, we're gonna go chop it again and do everything from the cut in, we get 2668 - 9000 giving us an internal torque of roundabout 6332 lbf\*ft to make everyone happy. (Negative, because, torquin' it)
	- Stress in AB is $\tau_{AB}=\frac{T_{AB}*c_{AB}}{J_{AB}}=\frac{6332ftlb*12 *2in}{\frac{\pi}{32}(4in)^{4}}=6047 psi$
$$
\tau_{BC}=\frac{T_{bc}*c_{BC}}{J_{BC}}=\frac{2668*12*1}{\frac{\pi}{32}(2in)^{4}}=20382psi=\tau_{max}
$$
- so $\tau_{max}=20.4$ksi 
	- Max normal stress is also 20.4ksi, just at the 45 degree plane
$$
\phi_{c}=\phi_{AB}+\phi_{BC}= \frac{T_{AB}L_{AB}}{G*J_{AB}}+\frac{T_{BC}L_{BC}}{G*J_{BC}}
$$
$$
\frac{-6332*12*48}{11*10^{6}* \frac{\pi}{32}(4in)^{4}}+\frac{2668*12*24}{11*10^{6}* \frac{\pi}{32}(2)^{4}}
$$

#### Statically Indeterminate Torsional Loading
- The cheap and dirty supplement is throw the deformation compatibility equation in and it all works out neat
- $\phi_{AB}+\phi_{AC}=0$ just gets slapped on and works out
