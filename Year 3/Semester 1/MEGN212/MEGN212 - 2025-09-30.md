### Definitely not fifteen minutes late to class.

$$
\epsilon = \frac{\delta}{L}=\frac{3}{4}=0.75
$$
- In the given example
$$
\delta_{AC}=\epsilon*L=(0.75)(2)
$$
$$
\delta_{AC}=u_{c}-u_{a}=0.5
$$
- Which gets us the displacement of point C, holly jolly, holly day
### Taper Bar (with distributed force)
$$
\frac{F(x)}{A(x)}=E \frac{d\delta}{dx} \to d\delta = \frac{F(x)}{A(x)}* \frac{1}{E}dx
$$
- You have to start doing fucked up integrals 
$$
\delta=\int_{0}^{L} \frac{F(x)}{A(x) } * \frac{1}{E}dx
$$
### Saint-Venant's Principle
- Once you're more or less a width away from your load being applied, loads stop distorting things nearly as much

## Heating it up (actually statically indeterminate, not thermal effects)
- You have some far fixed at both ends with a known $F_{0}$, we know the area, we know Young's (E), we'd love to know internal forces to calculate stresses.
	- Bad news. Get fucked.
$$
\sum F_{x}=0 = -F_{A}+F_{0}-F_{B}=0
$$
- That sure looks an awful lot like one equation with two unknowns.
	- This is known as a problem with one degree of static indeterminacy - there's one reaction force too many floating around.
- Given that this is fixed at both sides, we know that $\delta_{AB}=0$, this is the deformation compatibility condition 
	- Chop this bar up, we're going to call $\delta_{AB}=\delta_{AC}+\delta_{CB}$
	- which is $= \frac{P_{AC}L_{AC}}{E*A}+\frac{P_{CB*L_{CB}}}{E*A}=0$
- We can do even more chopping and get that $P_{AC}=F_{A}$, if we chop far enough over to the left and isolate the force over there.
	- And same if we go chop on the other side, and we get that $P_{CB}=F_{B}$
- If we go do a little replacement, we ge tthat
$$
\frac{F_{A}*L_{AC}}{E A}- \frac{F_{B}L_{CB}}{EA}=0
$$
$$
F_{A}=F_{B}* \frac{L_{CB}}{L_{AC}}
$$
##### Concrete Beam Example
- Data given is that $d_{out}=80mm,d_{in}=70mm,E_{\text{steel}=200}GPa,E_{\text{concrete}}=24GPa$
$$
\sum F_{y}=0
$$
$$
F_{con}+F_{st}-80=0
$$
$$
F_{con}+F_{st}=80
$$
$$
\delta_{con}=\delta_{st}
$$
- Alright, time to get to work
$$
\frac{F_{ST}\cancel{L}}{200*10^3 \frac{N}{mm^{2}}* \frac{\pi}{4}* (80^{2}mm-70^{2}mm)}=\frac{F_{con}\cancel{L}}{24*10^3 \frac{N}{mm^{2}} \frac{\pi}{4}(70mm)^{2}}
$$
$$
F_{st}=2.55F_{con}
$$
$$
F_{con}=22.5kN, F_{st} = 57.5 kN
$$
$$
\sigma_{st}=\frac{F_{st}}{A_{st}}=-\frac{57.5*10^3N}{\left( \frac{\pi}{4} \right)(80mm^{2}-70mm^{2})}=-48.8 MPa
$$
$$
\sigma_{con}=\frac{F_{con}}{A_{con}}= \frac{-22.5*10^3}{\frac{\pi}{4}(70mm)^{2}}=-5.85 MPa
$$
- Figuring out how much it squishes
$$
\delta_{con}=\frac{-22.5*10^3 N* (500mm)}{24*10^3 \frac{N}{mm^{2}}* \frac{\pi}{4}(70mm)^{2}}= -0.122
$$

#### Principle of Superposistion
- Resultant stress or displacement can be determined by algebraically stress or displacement caused by each individual loading
- Conditions for this to work include:
	- Linear relation between loading and stress, displacement
	- Small deformations with no significant changes in the original geometry
---
$$
\delta_{p}=\frac{20*10^3 * 400mm}{200 *10^3 * \frac{\pi}{4 }(10mm)^{2}}=0.509
$$
- That 0.509 sure is greater than our gap so we're back to being statically indeterminate. As they say in the business, eat shit
- There's going to be a reaction force from the wall because, shockingly, this just in, the wall does not want to be pushed into.
- So writing our equation, we have that
$$
0.509 = 0.2 + \frac{F_{B}(1200)}{200*10^3 * \frac{\pi}{4}(10mm)^{2}}
$$
$$
F_{B}=4.05kN
$$
- We appear to need to go find applied loads in each segment to reasonably solve for stresses
- We got 20kN over in the middle, 4.05 kN from our right, and $F_{A}$ over on the left
$$
-F_{A}+20kN - 4.05 kN=0
$$
$$
F_{A}=15.95 kN
$$
- And we can go do a little cutting, cutting pretty close to A gets us that the internal force $P_{Ac}=15.95$ kN (in tension)
$$
\delta_{AC} = \frac{15.95*10^3N * 400}{200* 10^3 * \frac{\pi}{4}(10mm)^{2}}=0.406 mm
$$
