## Normal and Shear Strain
- Deformation $\delta$ is the change in any dimension associated with load or temperature induced displacement
- Strain is a measure of the intensity of deformation, and it's deformation per unit length
- Normal strain, $\epsilon$ is a measure of elongation( or contraction) in the normal direction
	- $\epsilon_{\text{axial}}=\frac{\delta}{L}$ is nominal or engineering strain, where $L$ is the original length and $\delta$ is still our deformation
	- If, for instance, you have a $\delta$ of 0.15in and an $L$ of 36in, you get $0.006944$ in/in
		- And yes, in/in would be unitless, but you do have to unit that
	- Lateral strain in a pipe or round object is $\frac{\Delta dia}{dia}$, and bam biddly bop, there's your strain
$$
|\epsilon|= \begin{vmatrix}
\epsilon_{xx} & \gamma_{xy} & \gamma_{xz} \\
a & \epsilon_{yy} & \gamma_{yz} \\
a & b & \epsilon_{zz}
\end{vmatrix}
$$
- So strain is also kicking it around as a second order tensor, so it does strictly speaking have nine little bits and bobs - don't worry about it too much. Normal strain is just rockin' around on the diagonal of this matrix
### Example

- There ain't no fuckin question? Load P?
- We're actually looking for normal strain in bar 1, *duh*
- ![[Screenshot 2025-09-18 at 10.01.07 AM.png]]
- Kid named similar triangles is going to pop back up
- The radio of $\frac{\delta_{2}}{a+b}=\frac{\delta_{1}}{a}$ which is just similar triangles popping up, this is the DCE - Deformation Compatibility Equation for kinematic condition
- $\delta_{1}=\delta_{2}=\frac{a}{a+b}$
- $\epsilon_{2}=\frac{\delta_{2}}{L_{2}}=0.003300 \frac{mm}{mm}*1200=-3.96mm$ (contraction)
- You plug the numbers you have in, and you get 1.44 mm of elongation (positive)
- $\epsilon_{1}=\frac{\delta_{1}}{L_{1}}=\frac{1.440}{1600}=0.000900 \frac{mm}{mm}$
- Determine the normal strain in bar 1 if there is a 1mm gap in the connection at pin C before the load is applied
	- You actually just smack the extra mm on your deformation and that's about that. Something to be aware of, but actually shockingly reasonable.
		- IF STRAIN IS STILL THE SAME, WHICH IT IS IN THIS CASE
- Now, in order to fully talk about a deformed shape you nee-

## Shear Strain
(title card)
- Shear strain is $\gamma$, the measure of angular forces due to shear force/stress
	- Which is the change in angle between two reference angles that were orthogonal before the load is applied
- We need a shear force for there to be a shear strain
- So you have some box, stick a shear force on top, get a parallelogram

- So our shear is going to be that little angle there, it'll be the $\arctan\left( \frac{\delta}{L} \right)$, in radians, where $\delta$ is the top deformation bit and $L$ is the long top length of the side.
	- If the $\gamma$ that spits out is positive, then the resultant interior angle ($\frac{\pi}{2}-\gamma$) is less than $90\degree$ 
![[MEGN212 - 2025-09-18 2025-09-18 10.23.46.excalidraw]]
- With this, you can get to doing some math
