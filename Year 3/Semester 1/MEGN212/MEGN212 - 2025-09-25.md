### Housekeeping
- Last of the exam material is getting covered this week
- Review probably on Monday, Oct 6th
### Everything Else

#### Brittle Materials & Yield Strengths
- Brittle materials exhibit little or no yielding before fracture - they don't really warn you, they just kinda snap
	- They're also much better in compression than in tension. I love concrete.
- Design against ultimate stress for brittle materials - ie, $\sigma_{allow}=\frac{\sigma_{u}}{FS}$
- This just in, temperature has an effect on materials. Craazy.
	- Most materials get noticeably more malleable at higher temperatures
- Machine steel's yield strength drops quite a bit by around 600 degrees F, which is rough.
- The "ductile to brittle material transition" is a thing that exists.
- Carbon content has a fairly large impact on yield strength of steels, but this is not a steel class. That said, even with all these properties, the elasticity modulus is still the same at like 29
#### Poisson's Ratio
- Relationship between the strain in both directions
- $\epsilon_{\text{axial}}=\frac{\delta}{L}$ and $\epsilon_{\text{lateral}}=\frac{\delta'}{r}$
- And then the poisson ratio, v, is $$v=-\frac{\epsilon_{lat}}{\epsilon_{\text{axial}}}$$
- For the vast majority of materials, the ratio, $v$, is sitting between 0 and 0.5
	- Cork is close to 0, concrete is sitting at like 0.15, rubber is all the way up at 0.5
- The SHEAR modulus of elasticity is G, and that comes up.
### Eggsample
- At proportional limit, an 8'' gauge length of 1/2'' dia. alloy bar has elongated 0.012'' and the diameter has been reduced 0.00025''. The total axial load carried was 4650 lb
- Find the proportional limit
$$
\sigma_{pl}=\frac{F_{pl}}{A}=\frac{4650}{\frac{\pi}{4}(0.5)^{2}}=23682psi
$$
Find the modulus of elasticity
$$
E=\frac{\sigma_{pl}}{\epsilon_{pl}}
$$
$$
\epsilon_{pl}=\frac{\delta}{L}=\frac{0.012}{8}=0.0015
$$
$$
E=\frac{23682}{0.001500}=15,788,000
$$
- That would generally be reported as 15.8 $*10^3$ ksi
- Find poisson ratio
By definition
$$
v=-\frac{\epsilon_{lat}}{\epsilon_{\text{axial}}}
$$
$$
\epsilon_{lat}=\frac{0.00025}{0.5}=-0.0005 in
$$
And then you just go plug that in to our equation
$$
v=-\frac{-0.0005}{0.0015}=0.3
$$
Find modulus of rigidity
$$
G=\frac{E}{2(1+\mu)}
$$
---
- A tensile test specimen of stainless steel alloy having a diameter of 0.495in and a gage length of 2in was tested to fracture
	- And you'll get given a shit ton of data
- Find all of these shenanigans.
- The proportional limit is where stress and strain are still proportional, which is roughly 0.002 strain on the in class graph (probably go embed it later), or 60 ksi strainwise ($\sigma_{pl}=60$)
	- The modulus is the slope, which is 60/0.002, spits out 30,000 ksi as our estimated Young's Modulus (E)
- ultimate strength is the most stress we can carry, which on this graph is like 158 (just below 160)
- The yield strength is a little harder to read, you have to go from the value at 2 microstrain (0.2%) and draw a parallel line from down there and you'll get like $\sigma_{yield}=80ksi$
	- And that's our failure stress
- Fracture stress is where the stress line stopped at like 135
- Find the true fracture stress if the final diameter at the location of the fracture was 0.350 inches
$$
\sigma_{Fr}=\frac{F_{fr}}{A}
$$
$$
F_{fr}=\sigma_{fr}*A=135*\left( \frac{\pi}{4} \right)(0.495in)^{2}=25.98kip
$$
$$
\tau_{true_{fr}}=\frac{F_{fr}}{A_{current}}=\frac{25.98}{\frac{\pi}{4}(0.35in)^{2}}=270ksi
$$
Hooke's Law, $\sigma=E\epsilon$

---
$$
\epsilon=\frac{\delta}{L}
$$
where
$$
\delta=\frac{F*L}{E*a}
$$
- The F is INTERNAL force. You do have to do an FBD to figure out what it is.
- L is the length, E is the young's modulus, A is the area, and you get an answer in units of length.
- We're assuming everything is linear-elastic under Hooke's Law with ($\sigma=E\epsilon$), which is just kinda silly.
### Alright, getting to deforming things
- A hollow steel (E=30,000 ksi) tube with an outside diameter of 2.75in and a wall thicknses of 0.25in is fastened to a solid aluminum rod that has a 2in diameter and a solid 1.375 in diameter aluminium rod. Loaded as shown
![[MEGN212 - 2025-09-25 2025-09-25 10.26.50.excalidraw]]
$$
\sum F_{x}=0=-F_{1}-44+20-30=-48=F_{1}
$$
$$
\sum F_{x}=0=-F_{2}+26-30=0,F_{2}=-4
$$
$$
\sum F_{x}=0=-F_{3}-30=0,F_{3}=-30
$$
Everything is in compression! Quirky.
- Calculate deformation in everything
$$
\delta_{1}=\frac{F_{1}L_{1}}{E_{1}A_{1}}=\frac{-48*42}{(30*10^3)*\left( \frac{\pi}{4}(2.75^2-2.25^2) \right)}=-0.0342
$$
- And the negative means it's in contraction
$$
\delta_{2}=\frac{F_{2}L_{2}}{E_{2}A_{2}}=\frac{-4*30}{10*10^3 * \left( \frac{\pi}{4}(2)^2 \right)}=-0.00382
$$
