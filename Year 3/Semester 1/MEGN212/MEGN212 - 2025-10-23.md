### More fun with pressure vessels
#### Spherical Exist. I wasn't here for the first ten.
### Cylindrical
$$
\frac{pr}{t}, \frac{pr}{2t}
$$
---
### Pressure vessel example time
- The cylindrical vessel has an inner radius of 1.25m and a wall thickenss of 15mm, made from steel plates welded along the 45deg seam. Determine the normal and shear stress components along this seam if the vessel is subjected to an internal pressure of 8 MPa.
- First up, check thin wall
$$
\frac{1250mm}{15mm}>10, \text{thin for sure}
$$
$$
\sigma_{1}=\sigma_{y}=\frac{pr}{t}=\frac{8 \left( \frac{N}{mm^{2}} \right)*1250mm}{15mm}=666.6 MPa
$$
$$
\sigma_{2}=\sigma_{x}=\frac{pr}{2t}=333.3 MPa
$$
- You can use mohr's circle to go crazy there and solve for the stress on the 45 degree seams

## Combined Loading - Axial & Torsion in Pressure Vessels
- Load on the end of a beam, axial of 2100 lbf and torsional of 8100 lbf/ft
- Need to make a cut at some point in the section and do a FBD
	- You get your cut, your forces are balanced on the opposite sides of your cut, it's how it goes. 
- Have deformation of some angle $\phi$ in the direction, and we can use superposition to look at the effects of both deformations, and superimpose em together (you literally just add them.) as long as the deformation is small
	- We have our load on the end of our cut section of 2100lbf axially and 8100 lbf-ft torsionally, and we're looking to slap a stress element on the x and y axes and visualize the stresses around there
- If we say that our little beam has a radius of 2in (diameter of 4), we can do some math
$$
\frac{2000lbf}{\frac{\pi}{4}(4in)^{2}}=159psi
$$
