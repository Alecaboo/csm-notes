- Stress transformation equations are a thing that exists
### Getting back into Mohr's Circle
- Wow, a circle still is awesome for representing a cyclical relationship
- Mohr's Circle gets to be dramatically more a pain in 3 dimensions, but, y'know, is what it is
- I did a bunch of paper work for this, so the notes might be inconsistent.

$$
c=\frac{\sigma_{x}+\sigma_{y}}{2}
$$
- To find our radius, we gotta find some triangle legs and let Pythagoras go nuts
$$
\sigma_{x}-c=\sigma_{x}-\frac{\sigma _{x}+\sigma_{y}}{2} = \frac{\sigma_{x}-\sigma_{y}}{2}
$$
$$
r = \sqrt{ (\frac{\sigma_{x}-\sigma_{y}}{2})^{2} + \tau_{xy}^{2} }
$$

- Max normal stress is going to occur at $c+r$ (we'll call it $\sigma_{1}$), and that's the first principle stress
- At $c-r$, that's our minimum normal stress, or second principle stress (we'll call it $\sigma_{2}$)
- The equation for those generally gets written as
$$
\sigma_{1,2}=\frac{\sigma_{x}+\sigma_{y}}{2}\pm \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\tau_{x}-\tau_{y}}{2} \right)^{2}+\tau_{xy}^{2} }
$$
- And the plus gives you sigma 1 and the minus gives you sigma 2
- The interior angle from our line is $2\theta_{p}$, referred to as $2\theta$ because 
$$
2\theta_{p}=\tan ^{-1}\left( \frac{\tau_{xy}}{\frac{\sigma_{x}-\sigma_{y}}{2}} \right)
$$
- Now hold on, we've been poking around the sides, what the hell's going on at our top and bottom?
	- Those give us $\tau_{max}$ happening at $(c,r)$ and $(c,-r)$, where c and r are the existing values that we have equations for that I'm way too lazy to fill back in

$$
c=\frac{-8+2}{2}=-3ksi
$$
$$
R=\sqrt{ \left( \frac{-8-2}{2} \right)^{2}+3^{2} }=5.83ksi
$$
$$
\sigma_{1}=c+r=2.83ksi
$$
$$
\sigma_{2}=c-r=-8.83ksi
$$
$$
\sigma_{1}+\tau_{2}=-6
$$
$$
2\theta_{p}=\tan ^{-1}\left( \frac{3}{\frac{-8-2}{2}} \right)=-31\degree
$$
- And from there you can draw your silly little stress element

- We can find average normal/shear stress, it's going to be $(-3,5.83)$ on the top (going counterclockwise)
