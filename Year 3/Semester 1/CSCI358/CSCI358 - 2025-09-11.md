$$
\neg(\neg A\land B)\land(\neg B\to C)\to(\neg A\to C)
$$
- By deduction, we can get to transforming this into matching the sides
$$
\neg (\neg A \land B) \land (\neg B \to C) \land \neg A \to C
$$
- First off, identify all of our premises
1. $\neg (\neg A \land B)$
2. $\neg B \to C$
3. $\neg C$
4. $A \lor \neg B$ (1)
5. $\neg A \to \neg B$ (4)
6. $\neg B$ (3, 5)
7. C (2, 6)

## Predicate Time!
- We finally finished propositional logic, now it's predicate time.
- All CS students must take CSCI 358. Alice is a CS student. Alice must take CSCI 358
- There's really no way that we can argue this with the powers we have in propositional logic, so now it's predicate time.
- First of all, definitions
	- Predicates are something we use for properties/relations, A, B, C, etc
	- Random variables like x, y, z
	- Quantifiers, $\forall$ and $\exists$
- $\forall x P(x) \lor Q(x)$
	- That means $(\forall x P(x)) \lor Q(x)$
- Predicate logic needs us to talk about domain
- Let $P(x)$ denote $x$ must take CSCI358
	- $\forall xP(x)$
- Forall says that a statement is only true if that's true for every student in the domain
- For exists is true if *any* element satisfies it
	- Ie, for the domain of all mines students, there exists one who must take csci 358
- Forall requires one false to be false, exists requires one true to be true
---
- Fucked up adventures with scope.
	- $\forall x P(x) \lor \forall y Q(y)$
		- It's what comes immediately after that defines scope
	- Of note, not allowed is $\exists x (P(x)\land \exists xQ(x)x$
		- If an x is in the scope of another x, that's what we in the business call a problem
----
- Negation of something, ie $\neg \forall x P(x) \equiv \exists x \neg P(x)$
	- And $\neg \exists P(x) \equiv \forall x \neg P(x)$
---
- Assume that the domain consists of all creatures
	- "All lions are fierce"
	- "Some lions do not drink coffee"
	- $\forall x(P(x)\to F(x))$
	- $\exists xQ(x)\land D(x)$
