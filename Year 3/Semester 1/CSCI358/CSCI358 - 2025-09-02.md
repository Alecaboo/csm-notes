### Practice Activity
- A → B
	- That's satisfiable, but not always.
- A → A
	- That looks awfully tautological to me
- A → ¬B ∨ ¬ C
	- That can be satisified, but not tautologically. If both B and C are true, it'll be True to False, which spits out false
- A ∨ B →B 
	- That again can be satisfied but not always
- (A ∧ B) → (A ∨ B)
	- Satisfiable but not always
- A ∨¬A → B ∧ ¬ B
	- That right there's a contradiction. It simplifies to T → F, which is always false.

- (A ∨¬B ∨¬ C) ∧ (¬ A ∨B ∨ ¬ C) ∧ (A ∨ B ∨ C)
	- False True True
		- Spits out a false
	- True True True
		- Spits out a True
	- So, we're satisfiable
- A ∧ (¬ A ∨ B) $\leftrightarrow$ B ∨A

- Horrifying list of laws that I don't want to type out all the symbols for, but we have:
	- Double negation law
		- Not not A is just A.
	- Identity Laws
		- A and True is just A.
	- Domination Laws
		- A or True is just True.
	- Commutative Laws
		- A and B is the same as B and A
	- Associative Laws
		- (A and B) and C <-> A and (B and C)
	- Idempotent Laws
		- A or A is A. A and A is A.
	- Distributive Laws
		- A or (B and C) == (A or B) and (A or C)
	- DeMorgan's Laws
		- Not (A and B) is the same as (not A or not B)
	- Implication Laws
		- A->B = not B ->  not A = not A or B
