- Thevenin and Norton equivalents are circuit simplifications that focus on terminal behavior, and can be applied to ANY circuit
### Thevenin
- A Thevenin equivalent circuit is an independent voltage source $V_{th}$ in series witha. resistor $R_{Th}$ which replaces the interconnection of sources and resistors.
- For an open at terminals a and b of the Tevenin equivalent circuit, the open circuit voltage drop from a to b is $v_{oc}=V_{Th}$
- For a short circuit, the $i_{sc}=\frac{V_{Th}}{R_{th}}$

### Norton
- Norton is where you have an independent current source $I_{N}$ in parallel with a norton equivalent resistance of $R_{N}$
- The short circuit across the terminals will spit out $i_{sc}=I_{N}$
- If you're open at a and b, you get the open circuit voltage drop of $v_{oc}=I_{n}R_{n}$
- Amusingly, $R_{N}=\frac{v_{oc}}{i_{sc}}=R_{Th}$, which carries through from the transformations
### Going over some specific techniques

##### Technique 0
- The most basic way is to just apply source transformations repeatedly until you've simplified the circuit down to nothing
	- Unfortunately this only really works with independent sources, because it's actually god damn miserable to possibly do this with dependent sources in the mix

	- We can call that 25V and 5ohm left side into a 5A current source
		- And now, both 5A and 3A are going into that top node, so we can simplify it into being 8A going up
		- And 5 and 20 are just straight up in parallel, so that turns into 4 ohms
			- And then, you combine the 4 ohm and 4 ohm and get 8 ohms, which would be a 32V source if you go Thevenin 
##### Technique 1
- Find the open circuit voltage using any method you know
- Put a short circuit, solve it using any technique you know
- This *does* work for circuits that have dependent sources, but it DOES NOT work with *ONLY* dependent sources. What a silly little circuit.![[Screenshot 2025-09-22 at 10.21.00 AM.png]]
- Find the open circuit voltage, we're going to go set that lower node as our reference node and use node voltage, 
- To KCL out of the node above the 3A, we have $\frac{v_{1}-25}{5}+\frac{v_{1}}{20}-3=0$
	- We get that $v_{1}=v_{oc}=32V$
- Now, if we go short the circuit, stick a wire across A and B, get the new KCL equation of $\frac{v_{2}-25}{5}+\frac{v_{2}}{20}-3+\frac{v_{2}}{4}=0$
	- Solve that, you get $v_{2}$ = 16V, and thus $i_{sc}=\frac{v_{2}}{4}$
- For the thevenin result, we get that $v_{Th}=v_{oc}=32$ and $R_{th}=\frac{V_{oc}}{i_{sc}}=\frac{32}{4}=8$
- And for the norton you just use $I_{N}=i_{sc}=4$ and $R_{N}=\frac{v_{oc}}{i_{sc}}=\frac{32}{4}=8$
##### Technique 2
- This one works for ONLY independent sources. No dependents.
	- If you're finding thevenin, find the oc voltage, find the short circuit current for norton
- Now, go deactivate independent sources and replace them with shorts/open![[Screenshot 2025-09-22 at 10.29.53 AM.png]]
- We're looking for the thevenin, so we're going to look for open circuit voltage
	- Setting up our KCL with the bottom as our reference, we get $\frac{v_{1}+36}{12000}-0.018+\frac{v_{1}}{60000}$
	- I did paperwork in the middle of this example. Whoopsies.
##### Technique 3
- This can work for a mix of independent and dependent, but it can also work for purely dependent networks, which is neat
- If we're finding thevenin, find the oc voltage, norton find sc current
- Deactivate any independent sources
- Slap in a 1V test voltage source
