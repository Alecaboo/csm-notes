### Quick Bit on Signs

![[EENG281 - 2025-08-27 2025-08-27 10.02.38.excalidraw]]
- In the passive sign convention, it "absorbs" power, and is acted upon
- In the active sign convention, we're treating it like a battery
	- If you think about something as a resistor but used active sign convention, you'll just get a negative number as an answer and that'll be that. 
- **If you're going out of the negative, that's passive sign convention (psc)**
- It really doesn't matter what convention you use, we generally default to the passive sign convention, but it can be inconvenient if you refuse to switch. 
	- It's "one less thing to worry about, one less thing to worry abouuut" if you just default to psc

- In this case, my misaligned battery has an active sign convention, and the resistor has a passive sign convention. Again, completely fucking arbitrary.
### Review Aside, the Real Lectureâ„¢ (Power and Energy)
- Voltage and current are the main ways that you can look at a circuit
- Power and energy are unfortunately also rather important, because that's generally what people talk about
	- Case in point, some arbitrary example like "a pump motor rated at 75 kW can deliver more lps than a 7.5 kW pump"
- Anything real and practical has a limitation on how much power it can handle
	- Motors can fail. Light bulbs explode. Resistors melt. There are limits.
		- On that resistor melt note, there's a funny point in-between "that's not a resistor anymore" and "business as usual" where resistance briefly changes due to physical properties changing. How silly.
			- Related related: what happens to air at high voltage. tee-hee.
- We can relate power/energy with voltage and current using our sign convention shenanigans! awesome!
- Power is the rate of energy flow.
	- The defining equation for power is: $$
p=\frac{dw}{dt}
$$
- where p is power in watts, where w is energy in joules, and t is time in seconds.
- Watts are defined as joules per second.
$$
p=\frac{dw}{dt}, i = \frac{dq}{dt}, v=\frac{dw}{dq}B
$$
- So power is our rate of change of energy, current is rate of change of charge, voltage is rate of change of energy with respect to charge.
- You can do some fake math, cancel a derivative or two, act like it makes sense, and you can get power is $p=vi$. 
	- For record's sakes, what was written on the board was $p = \frac{dw}{dt}=\frac{dw}{dq}* \frac{dq}{dt}=vi$, which is definitely, absolutely, not real math.
- Power is the product of the current going through it times the voltage across, which makes sense. That's power. Wowee.
- We *should* be able to tell from our math whether power is being delivered to or extracted from the element.
	- If you want to use the same word, "delivered to" or "delivered by" means the same thing.
- When you use the passive sign convention correctly, positive will be power delivered to the element.
	- Generally, there's not that many sources in a system, so it makes sense to make the thing you deal with all the time be positive (the consumers).
- If power (p) is greater than 0, power is being delivered to the element. ðŸ¤¯
	- If power (p) is less than zero, power is being extracted.
- Voltage or current can be positive or negative, and the math works out to be what you get for power.
- If the reference direction for the current is the same as the reference for the voltage, you'll get the correct value out of power.
- If you do it backwards, you gotta smack in a negative sign. Business as usual, tbh.

- We have that picture, and $i=4$A and $v=10V$
- We're using passive sign convention, so we're just going $p=vi$ and multiplying across, so we get that this is absorbing 40W.
- Now, flip the picture, arrow going into the negative sign, and now voltage is -10V
	- We get that this is an active sign convention, so we're just going to smack a negative sign in, which then cancels with the negative sign on the voltage, giving us that this is absorbing 40W.
- Keep the picture flipped, arrow into the negative, current is now -4A and voltage is 10V, we still get that this is absorbing 40W. I love all the different ways to write the same thing.
- If we keep the active sign convention and don't flip any values (so still 4A and 10V), we end up with -40W, meaning that it's *supplying* 40W.

$$
\begin{matrix}
i=0, & v=0 & t<0; \\
i=20e^{-5000t}A & v=10e^{-5000t}kV & t\geq_{0}
\end{matrix}
$$
-  Calculate the power supplied to the element at 1ms.
- Calculate the total energy (in joules) delivered to the circuit element
##### Solution:
- Since the current is passive sign convention, we're positive, the power at any given point is just $p=vi$, meaning that $p=vi=(10000e^{-5000t})(20e^{-5000t})=200,000e^{-10000t}W$
	- So now we have a function of power, so we put in $p(0,001s)$ to our function, and we get a power of $9.08 \ W$
	- If we invert the definition of power ($p=\frac{dw}{dt}$), energy is going to be the integral, or $w(t)=\int_{0}^{t}p(\tau)d\tau+w(0)$
	- $\Delta w_{total}=w(\infty)-w(0)=\int_{0}^{\infty}200,000e^{-10,000\tau}d\tau$
	- Which then gives ya $\frac{200,000e^{-10,000\tau}}{-10000}\Big|_{0}^{\infty}=20$

#### Balancing Power
- A pretty easy way to check your work is to balance the power in the circuit, if you add everything up with the same sign convention you *should* end up at zero.
- There's an actually awful example that I am way too lazy to write out all the details of.
- We have 2280W of goodies to play with, and then everything else should subtract off regardless of sign convention, soo, $2280-100-10-90-500-(120*4)-(220*5)=0$, which works out neatly. 
	- The way this whole example works out was that you basically just randomly picked directions for current
- You can pretty easily nail down a singular sign error by just dividing it by two, ie, if you're off by -20, that means you probably flipped signs on a 10.
