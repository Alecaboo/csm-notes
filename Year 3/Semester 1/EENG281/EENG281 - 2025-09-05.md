## Generic Notes
- Everything happening in this chapter is DC - direct current - which is a constant voltage/current that doesn't change with time.
#### Touch Screens
- Resistive touch screens is how they all used to be, now phones and such are largely capacitive.
- Resistive screens can more or less be modeled by a grid of resistors in the x and y directions, and when you touch your finger down, closes the circuit, you get the idea.
### Resistors in Series
- Series circuit elements carry the same current (that's the definition of series)
- You can KCL to each node in the circuit, you can have a jolly old holiday, it tends to work out.
	- Since it's the same current, you can get rid of all the shenanigans happening on the elements of the circuit, and simplify to one source current
- The whole series resistor bit is a thing that exists. You can make them one big resistor where you slap them all together (that's it. you just add them. it's basic circuits.) Cheers and celebration for you.
- Voltage across an individual element in going to be $v_{4}=R_{4}i_{s}= R_{4} \frac{v_{s}}{R_{1}+R_{2+\cdots+R_{L}}}=\frac{R_{4}}{R_{eq}}v_{s}$
### You're not going to guess what comes next. <sub>(Resistors in Parallel)</sub>
- If we have four resistors in parallel, the voltages are all going to be the same, so we're using KCL to do our solving.
- So our sum current, $i_{s}$, is going to be $i_{1}+i_{2}+i_{3}+i_{4}$
- We can use Ohm's Law, since we know the voltage, so $v_{s}=i_{1}R_{1}=i_{2}R_{2}=i_{3}R_{3}=i_{4}R_{4}$
	- So if you bother to go solve that, $i_{1}=\frac{v_{s}}{R_{1}}$, etc, etc
- Or, if we're looking into finding $i_{s}$, the equation is going to be $i_{s}=v_{s}\left( \frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}+\frac{1}{R_{3}}+\frac{1}{R_{4}} \right)$, oooor, $\frac{i_{s}}{v_{s}}=\frac{1}{R_{eq}}=\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}+\frac{1}{R_{3}}+\frac{1}{R_{4}}$
- The conductance of a resistor is $G=\frac{1}{R}$, which is mostly just given to fuck with you.
- Equivalent *conductance* of parallel resistors is just their neat and tidy sum
#### Neat little special case (Just two resistors in parallel)
$$
R_{eq}=\frac{R_{1}R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}
$$
- That exists. That's a thing.
### Anyways
- The current through a single resistor in a parallel set is $$
i_{3}=\frac{v_{s}}{R_{3}}=\frac{R_{eq}i_{s}}{R_{3}}=\frac{R_{eq}}{R_{3}}i_{s}
$$
- The neat bit is that you just flip that for conductance (because... reciprocal....) and get $\frac{G_{3}}{G_{eq}}i_{s}$

- Alright, let's get the easy shit out the way, that shenanigans on the end is 9Ω. Get outta here.
- Now, our new 18Ω and 9Ω are in parallel, we can be lazy and use the two special rule, and we get 162/27 which spits out 6Ω.
	- That's now in series with our 4Ω that was originally sitting around, and we get an equivalent resistance for the entire circuit of 10Ω. Holly jolly day.
- Ohm's Law calls to me, so 120V/10Ω spits out 12A.
	- That's $i_{s}$! 
- WE can now backtrack, and determine that $v_{1}=12A*6Ω=72V$
	- And we have that resistance, so $i_{1}=\frac{72V}{18Ω}=4A$ and $i_{2}=\frac{72V}{9Ω}=8$

- Alrighty, so, to work this bad boy you gotta simplify some resistors, do some shenanigans, you get an equivalent resistance of 12Ω (I'm way too lazy to type it all out.)
- The voltage across the source is then going to be 5A * 12Ω which gives ya 60V.
- The current through the 30Ω resistor is then just going to be the entire load, so, 60V/30Ω is going to be 2A.
	- You can tap KCL to use on that node by the 30Ω resistor, and if 2A is going down to 30Ω, that means the 7.2Ω route is using 3A.
		- Tap KVL and Ohm's law, we can do $-v+i*7.2Ω+i_{C}*6Ω+i_{C}*10Ω=0$
			- Substitute $v$ and $i$ into that equation and you get that $i_{C}=2.4A$
				- Apply Ohm's law back again and get 24V

- When there's no load resistor, we have a voltage divider of 75kΩ and 25kΩ, and we only care about the voltage across one of them
- The voltage divider equation was $v_{o}= \frac{75k}{75k+25k}*200V=150V$
	- Holy moly, it's 3/4 of the voltage
- When we hook up our brand new tasty 150kΩ, we now become a single parallel resistor of value 50kΩ (75\*150/225)
- Then we go back to voltage divider, and we get $v_{o}=\frac{50k}{50k+25k}=133.3V$

- Look, there's a third problem here, and I'm rapidly getting to my limit of bothering to write these out.

- Alright, fine, you simplify the resistors
	- 10Ω + 50Ω = 60Ω
	- 60Ω || 30Ω || 20Ω = $\frac{1}{\left( \frac{1}{60}+\frac{1}{30}+\frac{1}{20} \right)}=10Ω$
	- 40+10+70= 120Ω
- The source current is then going to be $i_{40}=\frac{60V}{120Ω}=0.5 \ A$
- We can then calculate that $v_{o}=0.5A*40Ω=20V$
- By KVL, we can go that $-60V+v_{o}+v_{30}+i_{40}*70Ω=0$
	- Honestly I'm just scribing and not thinking about this at all
	- Solve for $v_{30}=5V$
- Current is just going to be $i=\frac{V_{30}}{30Ω}=0.167A$
- To find $v_{10}$ you use a voltage divider with the 10 and 50 ohm resistors, ie a voltage division of $v_{30}$, or
	- $v_{10}=v_{30} * \frac{10}{10+50}=0.833V$
- That was awful.
