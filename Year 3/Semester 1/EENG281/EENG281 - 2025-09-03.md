- Full voltage of a circuit is across an open switch
- Being in series still means that current is the same across all of them
	- All series things share the same current, not all things with the same current are in series
- Nodes in a circuit are connections between two or more elements

### Today's a Kirchoff kinda day
#### Kirchoff's Current Law: KCL
- The algebraic sum of currents entering or leaving any node must equal zero (charge has to be conserved)
	- Alternatively, the sum of currents leaving must equal the sum of currents entering
##### Now, do some fucked up and evil shit

- So getting started on our Kirchoff equations: 
$$
\text{Node a: }i_{1}-i_{2}+i_{4}-i_{5}=0
$$$$
\text{Node b: } -i_{1}+i_{2}-i_{a}+i_{3}-i_{b}=0
$$$$
\text{Node c: } i_{b}-i_{c}-i_{4}-i_{3}=0
$$$$
\text{Node d: } i_{c}+ i_{a} + i_{5} = 0
$$
#### Kirchoff's Voltage Law, KVL:
- The algebraic sum of the voltages around any closed path must equal zero (energy conservation)
	- We damn well better be back where we started with a net of zero if we do a full trip.
	- Generally, we add voltage drops, but there are no hard and fast rules there.
		- ie, going from + -> - would be a positive drop

- I'm just going to start copy pasting pictures of these damn circuits in.
- You can make basically any path you want, ie, path a around the top
	- Path a, for instance, is $-v_{1} +v_{2} + v_{4} - v_{b}-v_{3}=0$
	- Path b, around the left middle loop, is $-v_{a}+v_{3}+v_{5}=0$
	- Path c, $v_{b}-v_{4}-v_{c}-v_{6}-v_{5}=0$
- Obligatory reminder that the signs on any given thing are completely made up and arbitrary and nothing is real.

### Silly little circuit
- $v_{3}$ is going to be 120v, so $\frac{v}{r}=15A=i_{3}$
- $i_{2}=\frac{v}{r}=5A$
- Twenty amps coming in to battery, gotta be twenty amps coming out, so $i_{1}=20A$
- Do a silly little loop for the left side, 200V coming in, 120V going out, so we gotta have an 80v drop, giving us a resistance of four ohms. Yippee.
