## Node Voltage vs Mesh Current
- There's no *great* answer, but generally you want the one with less equations.
### Example Time

#### Mesh Current Example
- We have five meshes (all of our little rectangles)
	- Which, one of those does just spit out the answer, buuuuut, we do have 5-6 equations that we have to solve simultaneously.
		- Now like, if we're working in EES or Wolfram something, awesome
#### Node Voltage Example
- We have a whopping four essential nodes, which means we really only need 3 (or less) equations to describe the circuit effectively.
- A voltage source across the two nodes in the middle can make it a super-node, which is cutesy quirky and gets us down to two equations.
- However, said two equations are fucking *nasty*
- If you pick the bottom middle node as your reference, 
	- You get simpler equations and the node directly above the voltage source is directly determined by the voltage source
##### Aside
- Node voltage always works! Computers solve circuits using node voltage, because it works every time even on heinously complicated circuits
#### Back to node voltage

KCL at $a$
$$
\frac{v_{a}}{200}+\frac{v_{a}-256}{150}+ \frac{v_{a}-v_{b}}{100}+ \frac{v_{a}-v_{c}}{300}=0
$$
KCL at $c$
$$
\frac{v_{c}}{400} + \frac{v_{c}+128}{500} + \frac{v_{c}-v_{b}}{250} + \frac{v_{c}-v_{a}}{300}=0
$$
Constaint equation at $b$
$$
v_{b}=50 i_{\Delta}=50 \frac{v_{c}-v_{a}}{300}=\frac{v_{c}-v_{a}}{6}
$$
- If you go through the matha nd solve that, $v_{a}=62.5$ and $v_{c}=-8$, constraint yields that $v_{b}=-11.75$
- The problem requested power in the 300 ohm, which is then just $i_{\Delta}=\frac{v_{c}-v_{a}}{300}=-0.235A$, $i_{\Delta}^{2}*300=16.57W$

### Anotha One

- Mesh current says we have two meshes, current source in the middle gives us a supermesh, so one supermesh equation and one constraint equation, with current through 100v given directly by mesh current
	- Mesh CW KVL gives us $+25+i_{1}(30)+i_{2}(5)+100=0$
	- Constaint $i_{1}-i_{2}=7.5A$
	- $i_{1}=-2.5,i_{2}=-10$
	- We're looking at *delivered* power, and we have some sign convention shenanigans afoot, so $i*100=i_{2}*100$, but it's negative, but we're in some funky sign conventions, so we're at 1 kW
- Node voltage says we have two essential nodes (we have two nodes.), use the bottom node as reference
	- So we only have one equation, but we have to do some post solution calculations to get the realsies answer, so it's generally just kind of a wash
		- Single KCL at the top node gives us $\frac{v+25}{30}+7.5 + \frac{v-100}{5}=0$, giving us that $v=50$
		- Gotta do some shenanigans now for the current through the 5Ω resistor, so $i=\frac{100-v}{5}=\frac{50}{5}=10A$
		- And then $i*100=1000W$, soooo, same answer
- I think mesh happened to work out neater that time, but, :FasShrimp:

### Ok but I heard you wanted another example
![[Screenshot 2025-09-15 at 10.29.01 AM.png]]
- Mesh currents gives us four meshes, buuuut, two of them are set by current sources (top one is -15A, the right one is whatever $i_{dc}$ spits out)
	- Which leaves us with two equations, which is pretty neat
- Node voltage has the four nodes as all essential, we'll call bottom left and go clockwise with numbering from there.
- That gives ya three node-voltage equations, with no supernodes, soooo, let's get meshy with it
- KVL for the left mesh gives $-420V+i_{1}*7.2\Omega + (i_{1}-i_{2})*20\Omega=0$
- KVL for the *middle* mesh gives $(i_{2}-i_{1})*20\Omega+(i_{2}+15A)*15\Omega+(i_{2}-i_{dc})*50\Omega+i_{2}*40\Omega=0$
- We're given power developed, so we can go around and find that the voltage in the 15A source is $250V$, the current then by ohm's in 15Ω resistor is $16.6$
- Do a little substituting, one two skip a few, you get that $i_{1}=16.6A$ and $i_{dc}=2.0A$
- Node voltage you get basically the exact same thing, except you end up with four equations in four unknowns
