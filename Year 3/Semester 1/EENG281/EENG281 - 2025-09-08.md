## Measuring Voltage & Current
- Generally harder to measure something rather than just calculate it
- The trick is to figure out how to affect what you're measuring as little as possible
	- So, for an ammeter (current measurement), an ideal one would have 0Ω of resistance and therefore 0V of drop.
	- An ideal voltmeter looks like infinite resistance, so it doesn't divert any current away.
#### Brief History of Meters?
- D'Arsonval Movement is the classic one, which is a physical spring up against a permanent magnet, which, yeah, magnet causes it to move. (We'll get into magnetic fields later)
	- Is this relevant? Who knows!
	- Parallel resistance is very small (not zero)
		- Using another resistor in parallel works to get our effective resistance of our ammeter to be even closer to zero.
		- Voltage is very small
	- Series Resistance is very large
		- Current drop is pretty low, but voltage drop is really high (so useful for using as a voltmeter)
- We can determine the resistance of an unknown resistor using something known as a Wheatstone Bridge
	- Useful for measuring resistances between 1Ω and 1MΩ

- $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ are known, and then adjust the value of $R_{3}$ until the current meter in the middle reads a zero.
	- $R_{x}=\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}R_{3}$
		- That pops straight out from Kirchoff's Laws
- If you replace the galvanometer in the middle with an equivalent resistor, we honestly don't know how to deal with that.
	- Eventually, we learn things known as "$\Delta$ to Y" or "$\pi$ to T" transformations. Jesus christ, that eventually might be right now.

- What would this look like?
	- For each pair of terminals in the $\Delta$ circuit, compute $R_{eq}$ as if the third terminal was disconnected
#### Transformation Equations for Delta to Y
$$
R_{a}=\frac{R_{1}R_{2}+R_{2}R_{3}+R_{1}R_{3}}{R_{1}}
$$
$$
R_{b}=\frac{R_{1}R_{2}+R_{2}R_{3}+R_{1}R_{3}}{R_{2}}
$$
$$
R_{c}=\frac{R_{1}R_{2}+R_{2}R_{3}+R_{1}R_{3}}{R_{3}}
$$
Y to Delta ^

Delta to Y:

$$
R_{1}=\frac{R_{b}R_{c}}{R_{a}+R_{b}+R_{c}}
$$
$$
R_{2}=\frac{R_{a}R_{c}}{R_{a}+R_{b}+R_{c}}
$$
$$
R_{3}=\frac{R_{a}R_{b}}{R_{a}+R_{b}+R_{c}}
$$

### Example Time

- Of note, we form a delta with the 100, 125, and 25 ohm resistors.
- We calculate the y equivalents
	- A is the bottom left, b is bottom right, c is the top point
$$
R_{1}=\frac{R_{b}R_{c}}{R_{a}+R_{b}+R_{c}}=10\Omega
$$
$$
R_{2}=\frac{R_{a}R_{c}}{R_{a}+R_{b}+R_{c}}=12.5\Omega
$$
$$
R_{3}=\frac{R_{a}R_{b}}{R_{a}+R_{b}+R_{c}}=50\Omega
$$
- So we redraw the circuit with our delta instead of our Y

- Now you simplify that using series and parallel, both legs of the diamond are 50 ohms, splitsies because same value in paralell, 50+25 is 75, 5 ohms kicking it out the back gives you 80 ohms in the end.
#### More Exampling

- You can maybe do like two neat little simplifcations, here, but overall it doesn't work out too neatly.
	- Sentenced to deltas for all eternity.

- And then get to simplifying this using series and paralell - each side of the hexagon is 120 / 80 ohms respectively, add em in parallel and get 48Ω, then slap em all together in series and get 80Ω equivalent
### Even More Godforsaken Examples

- We have two pi's floating around with 40-10-50 and 15-1-10 as pi's, but we could also make a y in the middle
- Honestly, zoned out and was texting in the middle of this. It's lowkey awful.
