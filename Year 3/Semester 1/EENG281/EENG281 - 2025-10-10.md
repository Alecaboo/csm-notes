#### visitor in a strange and foreign land now
- there is such a different vibe in this class, just for record's sakes

## today's lecture is awful
- Gimmick of capacitors and inductors is that they change over time, which is all neat, and awesome, and there's a good bit of intuition to be developed, but the math is a pain in the ass

- God damn it.
#### Inductors
- Me personally, I would not call myself an ICE fan, even if I do enjoy internal combustion engines.
- They're so neat and awesome, but he wouldn't use them at all because capacitors are just even more neat and even more awesome.
- Inductors are generally a coil of wire around some ferromagnetic core
	- Quick phys 2 bit rearing it's head again, the core is more or less for shits and giggles, it doesn't really matter

$$
V(t)= L \frac{di(t)}{dt}
$$
- With DC current (constant), $\frac{di}{dt}$ goes to zero, and you're just going to get shorts. Essentially, it turns into a glorified toaster.
	- Where $L$ is the inductance of the inductor, it comes from some math with the thickness of the wire and number of turns

##### Exampling
- Have some circuit with a current source at $i(t)$ and an inductor with 4 mH (milli Henries) of inductance
	- Generally, inductance scales with size
- Given:
$$
\begin{cases}
i(t) =0  & t<0 \\
i(t) = \stackrel{0}{0}e^{-300t}-8e^{-1200t}
\end{cases}
$$
- And we're finding $v(t)$
	- Important note - that top piecewise term is that the system starts denergized, which is basically saying we don't have a +C that we give a shit about.

$$
v(t)=4mH \frac{d}{dt}(8e^{-300t}-8e^{-1200t})
$$
$$
v(t)=4mH * (-2400e^{-300t}+9600e^{-1200t})
$$
$$
v(t)=-9.6e^{-300t}+38.4e^{-1200t}
$$
- That's two competing exponentials, so, it... goes up, then it comes down.
- Voltage, however, spikes really high at the start, drops negative, then works its way back around to zero.
	- The inflection point of the current graph is the zero on the voltage, because... that's how the equation is literally defined.
- "We cast this into amps" CS background?

- Here's power!
$$
P_{L}(t)=i_{L}(t)V_{L}(t)=i(t)L \frac{di(t)}{dt}
$$
- Hey kid, you wanna make a railgun? Here you go! (this is actually the equation for total energy, but when you'd like to start chucking hunks of metal, you need some energy)
$$
w_{L}(T)=\int_{0}^{T} P_{L}(t)dt = \frac{1}{2}L *i^{2}_{L}(t)
$$

$$
i(t) = \begin{cases}
 t\frac{100mA}{10\mu s}& \color{cyan}0<t<10\mu s \\
200 mA - \frac{100mA}{10\mu s}t & \color{red}10\mu s<t < 20 \mu s
\end{cases}
$$
- Inductors are really, really, really good at making really high voltages, which means they're rather good at sparks

### Capacitor Time!
- It's parallel plates with an insulator in the middle.
![[EENG281 - 2025-10-10 2025-10-10 12.36.31.excalidraw]]
- Capacitors work by doing normal capacitor shenanigans of shoving enough extra electrons onto one plate that the other ones run the fuck away.
- Capacitors are our local energy storage gimmick, so are good for what we in business call 'transient current needs' - ie, you don't need it all the time, but when you do, you need a lot
$$
i(t)= C \frac{dv(t)}{dt}
$$
- Given some initially discharged capacitor with 250nF of capacitance and some voltage v(t) 
$$
v(t)=\begin{cases}
0v & t<0 \\
50e^{-4000t} & t>0
\end{cases}
$$
- Find $i(t)$, just an application of the equation
$$
\frac{d}{dt}(50e^{-4000t})=-200,000e^{-4000t}*250*10^{-9}=-50e^{-4000}t \ mA
$$
- Power across a capacitor is an equation that exists, but it's fucking horrifying to think about using this equation.

$$
P_{c}(t)=i_{c}v_{c} = C \frac{dv}{dt}v
$$
- Energy stored in a capacitor does actually matter, useful if you're using it as a short term battery
$$
w_{c}(T)=\int_{0}^{T}Pc(t)dt = \frac{1}{2} cv^{2}(t)
$$
- Quick example, generating the equation for power of our example capacitor
$$
P_{c}=i_{c}v_{c}= \text{Plug it in, I'm lazy}=-2.5e^{-8000t}\ W
$$
