### Difference Amplifiers
- Output voltage is proportional to the difference between the two input voltages
$$
v_{n}=v_{p}=\frac{R_{d}}{R_{c}+R_{d}}v_{b}
$$
$$
\frac{v_{n}-v_{a}}{R_{a}}+ \frac{v_{n}-v_{o}}{R_{b}}=0
$$
$$
v_{o}=\frac{R_{d}}{R_{a}} \frac{(R_{a}+R_{B)}}{(R_{c}+R_{d})}v_{b}-\frac{R_{b}}{R_{a}}v_{a}
$$
- Example problem
	- "Design a difference amplifier that amps the difference between 2 input voltages by a gain of 8 using an ideal op-amp, the supply voltages are $\pm$ 8V"
		- The problem statement requires $v_{o}=8(v_{b}-v_{a})$
			- From our previous adventure, we have that $v_{o}=\frac{R_{b}}{R_{a}}(v_{b}-v_{a})\implies \frac{R_{b}}{R_{a}}=8$
			- Basically just go pick some value like 1.5k and 12k and call it a day
- Honestly I ain't got no fuckin idea what we're doing anymore.
