- Discovery of fire happened in prehistory
	- Prof refers to it as "hangover history" - you have some kind of fuzzy memory of it, a general understanding - not specifics
		- To early societies, myths are a kind of hangover history
	- Gift of Prometheus
		- Originally passed down through word of mouth, until finally written down by the Greeks
			- Fire was for the gods, and Zeus made sure it stayed that way
				- Zeus was a real piece of work
			- In ancient India, Mahta(something) found it after it was hidden
			- Ancient Jewish text has fire as a thing taught by fallen angels
			- Aboriginal Aussies think we stole it from a rainbow serpent
		- Somewhere in the neighborhood of 400,000 years ago, we started cooking with fire
			- Cooking navigates some of the digestive process to fire, which means we need to dedicate less energy to digesting
				- We re-routed to brains instead
	- Whenever you have an energy transition, there's a debate of cost vs benefits
		- It's always the "theft" of fire
- There are almost always multiple energy sources
	- When hunting/gathering, it was mostly what we hunted/gathered, and was mostly utilized as metabolic energy
	- Humans started using fire to manipulate the environment
		- Haliastur Spirensis my beloved
		- We would burn forest in order to make grasslands for large grazing animals
- Anthropologist named Marshall Sahlins
	- Studied hunter gatherers that still exist in the world, and they're the "Original Affluent Society"
		- People in advertising in the 60's were talking about the "affluent society" - this was a big time of consumerism
		- They were actually rather sophisticated - manipulating fire to create resources, these people only look backward in retrospect
		- They enjoyed "Affluence without abundance," they had everything they needed, they were happy, healthy, not a lot of major inequality
- Paleolithic is the old stone age
	- Somewhere in the neighborhood of 8000 BC, we started domesticating shit
		- This was, in fact, an energy transition - our main source of (metabolic) energy changed fairly significantly
- What encourages energy transitions?
