One of the preliminary discussion points regarding the future of energy was about simplification, and I expect the next energy transition to represent a major step up in the simplification of energy, especially in production. All energy production on Earth can be traced to the Sun, and beyond that, nuclear fusion - I fully expect the next major shift in energy production to represent a step up the tree, with either the expansion of solar energy or, ideally, a full shift into nuclear fusion as a primary power source. 

Further expanding along the lines of simplification, ideally energy transportation will additionally experience a simplification - the vast majority of energy transported nowadays is done through either lithium ion batteries, or direct transport of fuel - so simplification of energy inputs across society, like from gasoline powered cars to electric, would represent further simplification. Ideally, the next big energy transition would also represent a shift away from lithium ion batteries, to a less disposable resource - but I am currently uncertain about what that would entail. 

To wrap it off, I don't expect this energy transition to be spontaneous - none of them have been, but a full refactor of society's energy network is going to be the work of decades, if not centuries - at this point, there are already centuries of existing infrastructure, spanning the better part of the planet - any shifts in any part of the network are going to require significant expenditures of resources, which is in turn going to make it even harder to justify shifting, especially if benefits are more esoteric than immediate.
