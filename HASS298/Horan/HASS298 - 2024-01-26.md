- Fossil fuels were providing 18 energy slaves per person
	- (2 billion pop, bit over 30 billion people of output)
	- Western World was most of this, representing approximately 40 slaves worth of energy
- Why fossil fuels instead of water?
	- I mean, you can ship coal somewhere, can't really ship a river somewhere
	- Energy density is crazy!
	- But still, why, why?
		- You need to go up high in the mountains to make a good water mill, but then you can't have as much agriculture, and then you can't support people, which means you can't stock a water mill, which... yadayadayada
- Oh hey, if we move to a city, we can get cheap labor
	- yeah, London was honestly pretty bad
	- people were in poverty, had some malnutrition, all this fun stuff
- Engines were being used to make it so factory owners could pay whatever they pleased( read: not a lot)
	- "I recognize that we're not up the road in Boulder, where 90% of the curriculum is debating Marxist ideologies" 
	- This made wage slaves (Marx term)
- One of the most fundamental forms of macroparasitism was denial of rights to women
	- So lots of energy progression tends to influence women's labor - image provided was flat / electric / steam iron
