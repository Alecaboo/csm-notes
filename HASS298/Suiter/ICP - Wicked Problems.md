## 1. What problem?
- Access to clean water
## 2. Why Interesting?
- Grew up consistently in a drought, which is just one potential root of the problem - there's all kinds of alternate causes.
## Definitions of a wicked problem
10. Can't get it wrong
	1. Further ruining water for a group of people is a pretty big problem.
9. Multiple explanations
	1. Why can water be "unclean?" Is it salt? Is it lead? There's dozens upon dozens of explanations for "unclean" water
8. Symptom of another problem
	1. Absolutely! Pollution can induce unclean water, which opens a whole other can of worms
7. Essentially unique
	1. Absolutely.
6. Effectively infinite solutions
	1. You can define a truly ridiculous number of solutions, from "leave the planet" to "reduce carbon emissions from manufacturing," and they would all contribute to clean water
5. One and done solutions
	1. Uh, yeah. Kinda hard to trial and error clean water.
4. No way to test if a problem is solved
	1. Where do we stop with clean water? Where does it end? This one, maybe not
3. Solutions aren't right or wrong
	1. A clean water solution will almost certainly produce waste - if we have leaded water, for example, now we have lead lying around, how much better is that?
2. Stopping rule
	1. Back into no way to test if a problem is solved
1. Can't effectively write a whole problem statement
	1. I reckon you could effectively write a small problem statement - ie for a small group or community, but overall impossible.
- So yeah, we satisfy just about every wicked problem definition.

## 4. 
- I reckon one of the most significant are that its a symptom of another problem - if you try to follow the tree of why clean water isn't, you just open a truly tangled knot.
- Another is being effectively impossible to write a problem statement - there can be no clear problem statement for the entirety of the issue, unless you aggressively subchunk and make assumptions. 
- Finally, not being able to get it wrong - if you're ruining a group's drinking water (more than it already is, presumably), that's a pretty darn big issue.
