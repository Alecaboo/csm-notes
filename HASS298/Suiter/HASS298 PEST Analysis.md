1. Success - Poseidon Water
	1. Political
		1. Poseidon holds several patents in the field they're attempting to work in - saltwater desalination through reverse osmosis
		2. Also received several subsidies from local governments in order to attempt to solve water problem
	2. Economic
		1. Very little competition, in a growing market, and the land they need is essentially "on the coast," which is individually expensive but overall rather accessible. 
	3. Socio-cultural
		1. Lots of support from society at large with very little backlash - there's not a lot of opposition to more clean drinking water, especially with as few downsides as desalination has
	4. Technological
		1. Already mentioned that they hold a few patents, and Poseidon is continuing to innovate in the desalination space - they're being supported by regular technological innovations in the field, which does a whole lot to make the business more economically viable, socially supported, and results help with political support. 
	5. Key Factors
		1. Scientific innovation
			1. Continuous improvement makes the entire business more viable, and is just generally a good time.
		2. Very little competition
			1. Poseidon has no large competitors in the areas that they've setup their business, which means they can completely absorb...
		3. Government subsidies
			1. Money from the government for setting up infrastructure is super nice
		4. No backlash
			1. Even if there isn't a huge desal craze, there is a non-negligible amount of support, and even more notably there is no significant opposistion.
	6. Done Differently
		1. If I were operating Poseidon water, I would probably attempt to expand to more locations - they're only really operating (successfully) in three cities, and there's a whole lot more than that along the coast.
2. Failure - Sustainability Co-lab
	1. List of factors
		1. Political
			1. Very little support from government, grants expired
		2. Economic
			1. No viable economic benefit, lots of cost for very little return
		3. Sociocultural
			1. Mild social support, but not supported by a huge movement or anything
		4. Technological
			1. Sustainability Co-Lab was attempting to rework a lot of systems that weren't really ready to be re-worked, with technology not quite being there
	2. Key Factors
		1. Grants expired - the colab could've kept going, even with a low financial viability with government support, however, they stopped getting it
		2. Lack of support - If society as a whole was willing to support them, the colab might've been able to keep their revolution going. However, they weren't.
		3. Lack of innovation - Not enough technological innovations to keep them going, so they ended up stagnating after not being able to improve.
		4. No economic benefit - Reworking systems to be less carbon-intensive is a noble goal, but one without a lot of economic benefit - which makes it significantly harder to garner support.
	3. Done Differently
		1. I would've attempted to prioritize keeping government grants as much as possible. The colab had successful results, and theoretically could've kept having them if they were still supported, but their grants expired and were not renewed, which just lead to them spiraling and dying due to not being for-profit.
