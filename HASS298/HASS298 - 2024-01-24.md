- Energy transition
	- mmm, we got plague, we got hunger, god I hate "progress"

	- Like nobles! Bourgeoise scum.
		- Distribution of labor tends to be uneven, and some people are feeding off the labor of others
			- Also known as macro-parasitism
- When you have a field of crops, you're suddenly much more vulnerable, and suddenly you can be oppressed 
	- To like, actually agriculture, you needed to have 90% of society engaged in agriculture (down from 100% of hunter gatherers)
		- Those 90% are equal! Equally in poverty.
	- The other 10% represents some additional stratification, including like military / administrative / clerical / ruling class

 
## Capek
- Describes a factory that produces "robots"
	- Perfect worker, yadayada, no proletariat
- Fun fact, robot comes from the eastern european for forced labor
- Has been described as an "energy slave"
	- Term originally comes from Lovosseur
	- machines would begin to replace human labor
		- and should be understood as slaves
