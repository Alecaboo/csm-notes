      "context": "Imagine the following notes were written by the user and contain the necessary information to synthesize a useful answer the user's query:\n---BEGIN NOTE: [[MATH112 - 2024-01-19]]---\n#notes #math112 #math #calc\n\n\n#### Reading Assignment\n13.1 \n\tApplications of vectors, pages 811-813\n13.2\n\tExample 7, p.832\n\nAlright apparently 6c is fun\n- If you're given a problem, feel free to parametrize $y=t$ instead\n\n\n---\n\n## realzies notes\n- Distance is the $\\sqrt()$ of all the differences between components squared\n- So now let's define a 2d circle rq\n\t- $(x-x_{0})^{2} +(y-y_{0})^{2}=r^{2}$\n\t\t- Radius r, centered at $(x_{0},y_{0})$\n\t\t- If it's less than or equal to, it's a disk\n\t\t\t- $\\geq$ is everything outside the circle\n- a 3d circle is known as... a sphere! ðŸ¤¯\n\t-  $(x-x_{0})^{2} +(y-y_{0})^{2} + (z-z_{0})^{2}=r^{2}$\n\t\t- Astoundingly, it still has radius r, and is now centered at $(x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0})$\n\t\t\t- $\\leq$ includes everything inside of it, and is called a ball\n\n##### Example\n- Find the sphere centered at the point $(1,2,0)$ that passes through the point $(3,4,5)$\n\t- We need our radius, which is really just finding the distance between the two points it passes through $r^{2}= \\sqrt{ (3-1)^{2} + (4-2)^{2}+ (5-0)^{2}} = r^{2}= \\sqrt{4 + 4 + 25} ||| r^{2}=33$\n\t- $r=\\sqrt{33}$\n- Equation for the sphere is now $(x-1)^{2} + (y-2)^{2} +(z)^{2}=33$\n\n\n### Alright, that was fun with coords, back to vectors\n- Vectors, again, have magnitude and direction \n\t- Let's say we have the point $P= (x_{0}, y_{0})$\n\t\t- and $Q = (x_{1}, y_{1})$\n\t- And we want $\\vec{PQ}$\n\t\t- This is the vector with tail at P and tip at Q\n\t- So $\\vec{PQ}$ would just be $<x_{1}-x_{0}, y_{1}-y_{0}>$\n- Vectors do not give *a single damn* about position\n\t- You can toss a vector anywhere in space\n\t- $P= (3,4), Q=(2,7)$\n\t- $S=(2,-3),T=(1,0)$\n\t- Find the vector $\\vec{PQ}$\n\t\t- This would end up as like, $\\vec{PQ}=<-1,3>$\n\t- Find the vector $\\vec{ST}$\n\t\t- Get like, $<-1,3>$\n\t- Oh hey, $\\vec{PQ}=\\vec{ST}$\n\t- Even though we got here different ways and they're vaguely different points in space, they're actually like, the same vector\n- It's convention if you have the vector $<a,b>$, that this vector would be from the origin\n\t- Convention to call that a position vector\n\t- Rounded brackets are for points\n-\n\n#### Magnitude of a Vector\n- Common notations\n\t- $| <a,b>|=||<a,b>||$\n\t\t- Textbook tends to use single bar like it's an absolute value\n\t\t- These are both equal to $\\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}$\n\t\t\t- Mildly shockingly, this works no matter how many dimensions your vectors have, which is a little surprising\n- Scalar multiplication\n\t- $c<a,b>$, where c is a scalar and $<a,b>$ is our vector\n\t\t- Scalar just means that we scale each component by it\n\t\t- so resultant would just be $<ca,cb>$\n\t\t- if we want the magnitude of $|c<a,b>|$\n\t\t\t- $|<ca,cb>|=\\sqrt{ca^{2}+cb^{2}}$\n\t\t\t\t- Could also just be $\\sqrt{c^{2}(a^{2}+b^{2})}$\n\t\t\t\t- We could drag that out $|c|\\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}$\n\t\t\t\t\t- Abs is to force positive of the c, since any magnitude has to be positive\n\t\t\t\t\t- You're just scaling the mag, same as the rest of the vector! It's not hard!\n##### Examples?\n- if $|c|> 1$ then magnitude increases\n- if $|c|<1$ then we're going to shrink it\n- if just straight up $c >0$, then we keep the same direction\n- if $c<0$, we're looking like a family business based out of waco (flipping)\n- if $c=0$, then we end up with the vector $<0,0>$, that's just a point, it's kinda boring\n\t- it is technically still a vector though \n\n\n#### Vector Addition\n- $<a,b,c>+<c,e,d>\\ = <a+c,b+e,c+d>$\n\t- This works the *exact same* for subtraction\n\t\t- Let's say that first vector was $\\vec{u}$ and the second was the $\\vec{v}$\n- $\\vec{u}+\\vec{v}=\\vec{v}+\\vec{u}$ commutative property goes WILD\n- This is the algebraic approach to adding vectors together\n- There is also the geometric point of view for vectors\n\t- This is what we in the business call \"tip to tail\"\n\t\t- The final resultantant is the original tail to final tip\n\t- Parallelogram also exists but like. bRuh.\n- Easiest way to think about subtraction is like a scalar of $-1$ \n\n\n\n- Oh boy, one final definition\n\t- $\\vec v$ is a unit vector is $|\\vec{v}|=1$\n\t\t- $\\hat\\imath=<1,0,0>$\n\t\t- $\\hat\\jmath=<0,1,0>$\n\t\t- $\\hat k=<0,0,1>$\n\t\t- These are all referred to as the standard or coordinate unit vectors\n\t- If I have some vector $\\vec v$ , I can make a unit vector $\\vec u$ in the same direction ad $\\vec v$\n\t\t- Let $\\vec u$ = $\\frac{1}{|\\vec v|} *\\vec v$\n\t\t- ---END NOTE---\n"
