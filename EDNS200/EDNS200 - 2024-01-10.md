- Good design went with was my fancy pen, which very clearly ha
- s a lot of aspects thought through - it feels really good to write with, the pen deliberately has flat edges to make the level possible to use / the ruler reasonable to measure with, and the stylus end can be unscrewed from one end and reattached to the normal pen end to make it easier to write with.![[annotated-1704916580.7672029.jpg.pdf]]

## General Discussion of Class Topics
- Talked about different kinds of experiences, what we think design and experience means, examples of designed experiences (like Starbucks and our expectations in there)

#### Kinds of Experiences
##### Prosaic
- General, everyday experiences that have absolutely nothing significant about them. Brushing your teeth is an absolutely normal experience that you're unlikely to have any specific memories of 

##### Memorable
- Generally start as a prosaic experience that has something significant about it - if you see a dog where there are normally no dogs on your commute to work, that particular commute is memorable

##### Significant? Something else
- These are generally infrequent experiences that have some kind of effect on you personally

##### Transcendent?
- Very infrequent, generally significant life impact
