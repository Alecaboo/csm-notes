### Memory and Attention

- You get sensory input, and if you don't throw any attention at it, it just gets utterly tossed out
	- Same thing with data and short term memory without repetition
- Ideally you want to tap into memory
	- there needs to either be something big, or repeat it, well, repeatedly

#### basic rules of memory
- Provide ways for stakeholders to turn your design into long term memory
	- Concentration
		- If you want them to remember it, they need to be able to engage with it,
			- Think about apps - how do they create focus?
		- 
	- Association
		- Create some kind of memory or association
	- Repetition
		- Keep coming back again and again

#### Miller's Law
- xcsedfgalmu
	- 7 is roughly the capacity of human memory

	- Chunking helps with 
- "The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus 2"
- There can be a lot of reasons to have 7 or less units of something - but the magical number need not be it
- 

#### Hick's Law
- Response Time = Time with decision making + cognitive time per option * $\log_2(n)$ number of alternatives
- Don't overwhelm your poor user

### Tips for Memory Friendly Designs
1. Don't make users memorize too much
	1. Think of games - wingspan has a whole lot going on, but you don't actually have to memorize much
2. Don't present too many elements to make a choice
	1. Menu at a restaurant with way too much shit going on is intimidating to a user
3. Use recognizable patterns and symbols
	1. Using common elements - if you're making a weather app, using conventions for like, blue rain, cloud shapes, snowflakes, all of that
4. Apply consistent navigational markers
	1. This is a bit more into web / app design, bit less for product design
	2. Let's say you're making a controller
		1. There are the consistent elements like joysticks, buttons, triggers
			1. You don't really want to shift very far from what's already been established
5. Don't hide core elements
	1. Look, show the important part - like the Democratic website having its donate now right front n' center
6. Stimulate different kinds of memory
	1. If you can tap long term memory, if you can give your user a sensory experience - the more kinds of memory you can tap into, the better


You can tap the hierarchy of needs over to design
1. Gotta be functional
	1. Reliable
		1. Usable
			1. And finally, pleasurable
- Bottom half of the pyramid is "verification" testing, you can just do it on a bench top
	- If you want to test if a water bottle won't break, we're just gonna drop the damn thing
- Top you'd need an actual user to do testing
