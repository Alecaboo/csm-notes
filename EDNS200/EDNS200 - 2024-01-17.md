### Elements of Good Design
- We're starting with graphic design in the 2d space, and what engages us, etc
- Visual rhetoric is how your audience interprets what is seen
	- Remember individual experiences, and what the "general" experience is
- Ethos, Pathos, and Logos are also important in visual rhetoric!

### Principles of Design

## Emphasis
- Your designs are going to end up with a focal point - do it on purpose
	- Create some kind of hierarchy


## Balance
- If a design is off-balance, the audience gravitates towards it

## Unity
- make your design cohesive
## Some quick other ones
- Contrast can really help create a focal point
	- Visually appealing
- Rhythm can serve as a means of creating hierarchy, with some kind of flow
- Proportion, if you have a base, can serve as a means of telling users about things
