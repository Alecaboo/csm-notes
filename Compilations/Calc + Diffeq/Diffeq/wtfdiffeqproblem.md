$$y = c_{1}e^{-2t}\cos(3t) + c_{2}e^{-2t}\sin(3t)+2$$
$$y' = -2c_{1}e^{-2t}\cos(3t) - 3c_1e^{-2t}\sin(3t)  -2c_{2}e^{-2t}\sin(3t)+3c_{2}e^{-2t}\cos(3t)$$
$$y' = c_{3}e^{-2t}\cos(3t)+ c_{4}e^{-2t}\sin(3t)+c_{5}e^{-2t}\sin(3t)+c_{6}e^{-2t}\cos(3t)$$
$$y'= e^{-2t}(c_{3}\cos(3t) + c_{4}\sin(3t) + c_{5}\sin(3t) + c_{6}\cos(3t))$$
$$y' = e^{-2t} (c_{7}\cos(3t) + c_{8}\sin(3t))$$
$$y'' = e^{-2t}(-3c_{7}\sin(3t)+3c_{8}\cos(3t))-2e^{-2t}(c_{1}\cos(3t) + c_{2}\sin(3t))$$
$$y'' = e^{-2t}(c_{9}\sin(3t) + c_{10}\cos(3t))+ e^{-2t}(c_{11}\cos(3t)+c_{12}\sin(3t))$$
$$y'' = e^{-2t}( c_{9}\sin(3t) + c_{10}\cos(3t) + c_{11}\cos(3t) + c_{12}\sin(3t))$$
$$y'' = e^{-2t}(c_{13}\sin(3t) + c_{14}\cos(3t))$$
- Good lord, that's a lot of constant shenanigans. Who hurt you people?
$$y = e^{-2t}(c_{1}\cos(3t + c_{2}\sin(3t) + 2))$$
$$y' = e^{-2t} (c_{7}\cos(3t) + c_{8}\sin(3t))$$
$$y'' = e^{-2t}(c_{13}\sin(3t) + c_{14}\cos(3t))$$
$$e^{-2t}(c_{13}\sin(3t) + c_{14}\cos(3t)) + 4( e^{-2t} (c_{7}\cos(3t) + c_{8}\sin(3t))) + 13 (e^{-2t}(c_{1}\cos(3t) + c_{2}\sin(3t) + 2))$$
$$= 26$$
$$e^{-2t}(c_{13}\sin(3t) + c_{14}\cos(3t) + c_{15}\cos(3t) + c_{16}\sin(3t)+c_{17}\cos(3t)+ c_{18}\sin(3t) + 2)=26$$
$$e^{-2t}(c_{19}\sin(3t) + c_{20}\cos(3t) + 2)=26$$
- I may have gone wrong in combining so many constants, but at this point I'm too far gone. This is going to work out, I think. Let's say $t=0$, since that should be a valid interval, and I want this to work.
$$1(0 + c_{20}+2)=26$$
$$c_{21}= 26$$
- And $c_{21}$ can be whatever, so yeah, $26=26$
