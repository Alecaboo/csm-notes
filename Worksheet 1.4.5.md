Should just be the area between the two functions![[Screenshot 2024-02-07 at 8.09.19â€¯PM.png]]
Lower bound is going to be 0 (where we all intersect the y axis), upper bound is going to be the intersection point at $(1,1)$ (1=1^2, 1+1=2)
(I just used desmos to get an accurate picture)

Upper function is just $x+y=2$, rewrite in terms of y, $y=2-x$
Want to get this all in terms of x, so $y=\sqrt{x}$ (from $y=x^{2}$)

$A(x)= \int_{0}^{1}((2-x)-(x^{2}))dx$  
$A(x)= 2x -\frac{x^{2}}{2}- \frac{x^{3}}{3}$ 
Plug in the bounds
$A(0)=0,A(1)=2 - \frac{1}{2} -\frac{1}{3}= \frac{7}{6}$
