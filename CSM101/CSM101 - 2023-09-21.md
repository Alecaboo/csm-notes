#notes #csm101


- Consulting Engineer for 5 years before teaching 
- Question from [[CSM101 - Faculty Connection Assignment]]ME is ABET accredited
	- Fundamentals of engineering exam
		- Study groups that happen int he spring
		- Rhett passed it
	- oh good lord it's a 6 hour test
	- Consulting groups greatly prefer you taking the test
	- $175 for test (can be covered by your work + a bonus)
	- Professional engineer exam (4 years in Colorado)
		- Transfers pretty well from state to state, you just need to do it once 
	- Something to worry about towards the end of junior year
		- Do that then, not after you graduate (want it to still be fresh)
	- Mines students have like an 80% pass rate without particularly trying 
- Postdoc research is neat
- "You're not gonna die with your degree"
	- Started a civil, but worked a whole bunch on mechanical stuff, realized they liked it more
- Flexibility is really nice, so you don't have to go back to school
- Dr. Rodriguez gives career day lectures right before career day, because actually working is important
- Obligatory go to office hours
- Be careful with what you can do with your degree
- Worked at a department of energy lab
	- Every DoE lab has a job, Idaho is nuclear, Golden is renewables
	- Parson Engineering Science
	- Government doesn't actually do any work
	- Did a bunch of weird, remote cleanup, because there was so much radiation and stuff
		- Lots of mechanical grounding needed for that
	- Downsides with government work
		- Moves at the speed of molasses, busy/slow/busy/slow, if you want to be constant 
	- Startups
		- Reputation as being exciting and all that, but you gotta work so much
			- Project management, budgeting, overseeing job sites, actual engineering
		- Quick way to burn yourself out
			- Interview whoever is interviewing you as well to make sure you don't get burnt out
	- There's a couple Mines students at every lab in the US, so be sure to reach out 
		- Los Alamos paid for a bunch of students Master's degree
- Make a time and stop studying before the exam so that you're not super tired beforehand
	- Thank god we don't have exams 8:30 
	- Study for the 7 days before an exam, but watch a movie the night before
- You're inevitably going to fail an exam, that's just how it goes
	- Thermo is the MechE tough class
		- Lots of people fail an exam and then go on to get an A
	- The real world is mean
		- You gotta be able to deal with being depressed, because the real world is very mean, and you gotta adapt to not doing that again
	- Circuits 2 was rough for Rhett
		- Don't bank on your teacher getting fired
		- Minor setback, major comeback
		- Most electrical exams tend to be take home, because it doesn't really make sense to do it common hour style
- Read the damn syllabus for office hours
	- They'll also be posted on Canvas, maybe your department, etc
	- Be confident, ask direct questions about what you're struggling with
		- Don't preface with "This is a dumb question"
	- Go to funky office hours like the day after homework is due, so less people are there
	- Plan ahead, get in to office hours early
	- Go in without starting the question or?
		- Most faculty would rather you at least attempt it
	- TA's have office hours, go to those as well
- Best advice for burnout?
	- Don't just go to class, do other things like clubs
		- MechE has a wellness committee, student groups, etc
	- Burnout comes from going to too much class and not enough stuff
	- Join clubs so you actually find value in your education right now
- 
- Mechanical has a 90 something % placement rate, the rest go to grad school
	- Mines mission is to actually get you a job, you're practically guaranteed to get a job if you want a job. 
	- "They go to this other school and all they do is watch Netflix all day!"
		- Yeah, but they're not going to have a degree
- School is going to get better - not easier, just to be clear - but better
- Labs vs reality
	- MechE talks to industry a lot, Mechanical has Mechanical Mondays where industry people come, even the classic courses like Thermo are geared towards industry, Fluids has software use in industry, for mechanical its really close to reality
		- Machine shop you're allowed in as soon as you get training, go wild
			- Boulder is cringe and has no shop access till senior year
	- Not a lot of "this is a fun academic thing," mostly stuff you'll actually do at a job. 
- MechE 200 is neat
	- They give you an Arduino and some software and tell you to make something happen
- Registration starts in Nov, Schedule released in october
