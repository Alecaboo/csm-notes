1. From the Mechanical Engineering at Mines website, Professor Rodriguez is a "registered professional environmental engineer" - I'm really curious about A: how accreditation works in engineering and how it transfers. I have a vague understanding of how teachers are certified, and how it transfers to different states, but I had previously only understood engineering certifications for individual skills, like a SolidWorks cert. To that end, I'm curious about how Professor Rodriguez's experiences have differed as an engineer who has worked in different states - is it basically the same across the board, by company, or were there some larger state transition changes?
