## Plan: Presentation

### Background:
- One of my things I discussed in class 9/28 was a bookmark that I got as a gift from a friend of mine who's an artist, and that bookmark is the latest in a series of drawings that they've drawn over the course of our friendship. Going to do a presentation (public speaking, slideshow behind me) talking about the different art pieces, as well as where I was in my life at the various points that they were given
