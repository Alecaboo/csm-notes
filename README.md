This is my Obsidian notes for the entirety of my time at Mines. There's a couple files in this repo for the viewing of the notes at the website ( https://aleccsmnotes.netlify.app/), but if you're an Obsidian enjoyer as well, feel free to clone or whatever else and view it locally. (The website was put together using netlify's free hosting and the wonderful [Obsidian Zola](https://github.com/ppeetteerrs/obsidian-zola), which I used instead of inbuilt Obsidian Publish because... I'm a broke college student. Give me a break. )

Only plugin that's really relevant when viewing the vault (I don't include my config folder, so you'll have to figure all that out) is [Excalidraw](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin) , which I use mostly for physics sketches and calc shenanigans so far. There's also a *lot* of LaTeX formatting strewn throughout the calc notes, which tends to make the website fuss a little bit, especially as I go between single and double dollar signs. That's probably the best argument for viewing locally.

If you start reading from the beginning, you'll see some of the growing pains of me figuring out how in the world I actually take markdown notes. The start of calc 1 isn't even typeset! It's horrifying. Don't shit on me too much.

Overall though, enjoy reading through my notes. They're completely accurate, and only mostly shitposts, so try to giggle at least once as you're reading through. Feel free to send this around to friends or whatever (I mean, it's a public repo, so you may have just gotten here through exploring), half the reason I take these notes is for them to be useful.
