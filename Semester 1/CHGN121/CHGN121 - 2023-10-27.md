## quick review of wednesday
- some electrons can penetrate and almost experience the full charge of the nucleus
	- Depending on the energy level, we'll have different orbitals
		- s can penetrate better than p, and p can penetrate better than d
- outer electrons will get shielded by inner electrons, and will not experience the full charge
	- Effective nuclear charge = \#protons - \#core electrons
	- ex, oxygen
		- 2 core electrons, 8 total, valence electrons will experience a +6 charge
## ion sizes
- cations are always going to be smaller than their parent, because we have a higher proton to electron ratio (>1)
- anions are bigger than their parent, because we have a smaller proton to electron ratio (<1)
- same number of electrons are isoelectronic species
	- in order to compare their sizes, compare ratio of protons to electrons
	-
