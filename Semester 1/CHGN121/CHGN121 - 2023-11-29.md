- Exothermic reactions are creating more stable products, endothermic reactions (which take energy) are probably less stable
- The heat change across a reaction is the sum of the bonds broken minus the number of bonds formed
	- there's a longass reaction we did for warmup, but the answer is -2,428
		- don't forgor the moles of the thing if you're


- 119.5 g
	- 0.06694560669 moles
	- -23 kj/mol
- $\Delta$ H is an extensive property, so if combustion releases energy, forming the reactants is going to be endothermic
- Hess's Law: overall enthalpy change is the same as the sum of all the lil baby reactions
