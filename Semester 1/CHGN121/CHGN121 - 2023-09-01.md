##### Clicker stuff
- Physical clicker is going to be on frequency AA, if I ever get one
	- 10 points per class session
		- 5 for participation
		- 5 for correctness
	- 2-3 questions per day, 30 seconds to 4 minutes to answer
	- If you missed a day, don't worry about it
	- Lowest 15% of clicker stuff will be dropped
		- No need to email about clicker stuff unless you are missing literal weeks of clickers
- Metalloids have metal & nonmetal properties 
### Atomic Stuff
- We use Carbon-12 as a scale for amu
	- Carbon 12 weighs EXACTLY 12 amu
		- 12.0000000000000000 amu
- Charges are handled in +1 for protons, -1 for electrons
	- Coulombs are objectively cool, but harder to do math with
- 1amu = 1/12 mass of C-12 atom = $1.66054*10^{-27}$
- Particle stuff
- $\frac{A}{Z}$X
	- A is mass number
	- Z is atomic number
		- Unique for every number
	- X is Chemical symbol
		- Fe for iron
- Atoms are always electrically neutral
- [[Ion]]s have charges n such things
- On the periodic table is the weighted average (in amu)
	- Not all neon(or any other element) atoms are created equal
		- The difference is the number of neutrons in the nucleus
		- This is called an [[Isotope]]
			- For isotopes only, they'll be formatted like C-12 (Chemical name, mass number)
	- individual isotope mass and mass numbers are NOT on the periodic table
	- For practice
		- Gallium has two naturally occurring isotopes: Ga-69 with a mass of 68.9256 amu and a natural abundance of 60.11%, and Ga-71. Use the atomic mass of gallium from the period table to find the mass of Ga-71
- All the fun chemistry happens at the atomic scale
	- Unfortunately we live in the macroscopic scale
	- How can we bridge the two worlds of the fun stuff vs where we live?
### Avogadro's Constant
- $6.022142 *10^{23}=$ 1 mole of stuff
	- Like 12 things arein a dozen
	- Aluminum has a mass of 26.982 g/mol
	- Copper is 63.546 g/mol
#### Other thing
- 1 water molecule, 2 hydrogen and 1 oxygen
- = 18.02amu
- Multiply by Avogadro's, mass of water is 18.02g
	- 2 moles of hydgen = 1 mol oxygen
