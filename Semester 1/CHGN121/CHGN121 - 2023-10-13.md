## baby clicker questions for babies
- decreasing pressure increases volume
- STP is definitely not 298K
- 0.0820582 * 273.15 * 0.85 = d, 19 L
- 0.15L of gas when you increase it
- e, lowering pressure by a factor of 3


## activity series stuff
- we're going to use the activity series when predicting if things will actually react with ionic compounds 
- hydrogen is our reference point
- anything above hydrogen will easily react in water to go from a metal to a cation
- lithium would *love* to lose an electron, lead can be coerced into it
- anything below the hydrogen reference are more inclined to gain electrons, especially compared to hydrogen
- A redox reaction occurs if the free, elemental metal can displace the ionic metal in the series
	- It can do this if it's higher in the activity series
	- So nickel can displace lead 

---
- we will always form a homogenous solution with gasses
	- don't talk about densities of various gasses
- KMT - gasses will always occupy the available space in containers 
- We must assume that gasses have no intermolecular forces, and that they experience elastic collisions
- Density = P\*molecular weight / gas constant * temp
