### Preclass Clickers
- Q1: A, 0.29 moles
- Q2:
	- 2SO<sub>2</sub> + 1O<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O -> 2H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
	- 25kg SO<sub>2</sub>
	- 0.39 moles 
	- 98
	- 38.22 kg 
	- A, 38 kg

### Real notes time
- week 6 survey n shit is due
- theoretically produce 70.5g of MgO from reaction
	- 2Mg + O<sub>2</sub> -> 2MgO with 42.5g Mg
- we only make 65.0g 
	- womp womp, 92% yield
- 70.5g MgO and reaction is 92.9% efficient
- $$\frac{70.5}{y}=\frac{0.929}{1}, y=75.88$$
- 1.88 moles, 45.8g of Mg
	- (yippee)
### What if we were given volume of reactant instead of mass?
- you convert it back into mass, goobers, use the density

#### grilled cheese (reprise)
- 2 breads + 1 cheese = 1 sandwich
- 28 breads + 11 cheeses = 11 sandwiches
- 2Na + Cl -> 2NaCl
- 5.8g Na and 6.7g Cl<sub>2</sub>
- 0.25 moles Na
	- 
- 0.094 moles Cl 
	- Cl is definitively the limiting
- 2.81 g of NaCl
	- Or maybe it's 11? wth did I do wrong
		- found what i did wrong, i can't do basic bitch fractions

42.g Mg and 33.8g oxygen produces MgO
- 2Mg + O<sub>2</sub> -> 2MgO
	- 1.72 moles Mg
	- 1.05 moles O<sub>2</sub>
	- 0.19 moles O<sub>2</sub>
	- Mg is the limiting
- 1.72 moles of MgO
- 69.316g of MgO
