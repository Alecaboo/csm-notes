- How can we find energy? A lot of ways, and a lot of them are the same
	- Calorimetry
		- Constant pressuer calorimetry, System is equal to the loss of heat in the surroundings
			- Enthalpy change is equal to heat exchange
				- Anything from the reaction is absorbed by solution
			- $38*(65.4-x)*0.385 =95.7*(22.7-x)*4.184$
			- $965.802-14.63x=-9089.27976+400.4088x$
			- 415.0388x - 9089.27976 = 965.802
			- 415.0388x = 10,055.08176
			- 24.23

	- Stoichiometry
		- Heat is an extensive property, meaning it does depend on how much mass you have
		- 3.004868913858
		- 5.32g of CH<sub>4</sub>
		- 
	- Bond Dissociation
		- Remember, positive to break bonds, negative to form bonds
		- 
	- Heats of Reaction
	- Heats of formation
