# Unit Two (dun dun dun)

## Chapter 5: Solutions & Aqueous Solutions 
yippeeee
- we're using molarity now!
- it's mols / volume (in L). shocker.

- we did some molarity practice questions, I am waaaay too lazy to write these out, but I got them right, I don't care.
- Most of the time when we're working lab, we have a high concentration stock solution, and we gotta dilute it to get something reasonable
- Moles that you take out of your concentrated flask is the same thing as the moles you put in the new sheet


- Molarity is mol / l 
- Molality is mol / kg
- Mole fraction is mol / mol
- Parts by mass is mass / mass * conversion factor
