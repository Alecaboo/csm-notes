- Electrons have mass?
	- I didn't even know they were Christian!
- oh boy, [phet](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/atomic-interactions/latest/atomic-interactions_all.html) time
#### Intramolecular Bonds
- They're stronger than intermolecular bonds, losers
- Even within intramolecular bonds, they vary in strength
	- Ionic bonds are metal + nonmetal
	- Covalent are nonmetal + nonmetal
#### Electron Shenanigans
- Fog plot, electron distributon plot, yadayada
	- Electrons are just kinda floating around, there are different probabilities of them showing up at a given point
	- On a fog plot, the darker the color, the higher the probability of finding an electron
	- Isosurface exists
		- 90-95% of finding electrons within the surface
		- The rest are outside
- Three general different distributions
	- Equally shared
	- Shifted completely to one side, practically to the point of a transfer
	- or shifted slightly to one side
- Forming a bond is a release in energy, creating stability
- Breaking a bond takes in energy
- Electronegativity is how different atoms attract electron distributions
	- Pauli or Pauling?
- $\Delta$EN = |EN<sub>Atom 1</sub>-EN<sub>Atom 2</sub>|
### Electron Distribution Examples
- Ionic bonds, at the gen chem level, we should assume a complete transfer
	- With this, we go from atoms to ions
- **Cat**ions are **paw**sitive, always
	- that wasn't in the notes, it's just funny
- Anions are bigger because they have more electrons
- Ionic bonds tend to have a $\Delta$EN > 2
- Covalent bonds
	- Can either be polar or nonpolar
	- Nonpolar have equal sharing, electronegativity is basically the same
		- $\Delta$EN must be $\leq$ 0.4
	- Polar have unequal sharing, resulting in a partial charge on atoms
		- (not to the ionic bond level)
		- $\Delta$EN should be $\geq$ 0.5
		- Good news: we're lazy, and don't have to worry about partial charges numerically
- ONLY THING we're doing to identify an ionic bond at the genchem level is metal + nonmetal
- Metallic bonds are communist, and are attracted to the general sharing of electrons
	- Electronegativity values are between 0 and basically nothing
### Ionic Bonds
- Cations and anions coming together for neutrality
- atoms have charges don't be an idiot
-
 - We're going to have 3 clicker questions 
- I should go do the mastering
