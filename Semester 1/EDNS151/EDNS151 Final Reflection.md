Overall, I feel like my greatest takeaway from this class was in terms of working with my team and other people, especially with different levels of experience in various fields. In various engineering classes through high school, most of which were part of a pathway - so no matter what, we had the same general basis of understanding. That wasn't the case through this class - I had expected people to have a relatively similar knowledge base, but that wasn't the situation at all. Learning to work with situations where I was the only one who knew how to work or setup something wasn't really a thing I thought would happen - I worked on our software, and I was the only one who knew what they were doing in any respect. I hadn't been prepared for this, but being able to delegate people to the tasks that they did understand made this much less of an issue - again, those previous projects were often too small in scope to reasonably split up beyond two people, but being able to divide work fairly evenly across five made people having different areas of expertise much more enjoyable. I'm looking forward to future design projects, and seeing what other specialties people bring to the
