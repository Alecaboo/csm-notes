- Actually going to need to use math and such things in your designs
	- Silly little sports shoe was very silly
- "Looks-like" prototype is due after idea generation
	- Accompanying field sketch
	- Looks like due in a week and a half
- Prototype should show what's novel
- "Works-like" prototype should be actually functional
	- Better be a piece of work, take about a week's worth of effort
- Solving problems by definition means that someone else needs to use it
- Draw novel aspects
	- You don't need to draw a bicycle, but if you have a special bike attachment, draw that
