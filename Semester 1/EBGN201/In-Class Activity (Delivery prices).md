Using the left graph

1. Producer and consumer surplus before the fee
	1. Consumer surplus: $$7000*7=\$49,000 $$
	2. Producer Surplus: $$7000*4=$28,000$$
2. Producer and Consumer Surplus After the fee
	1. Consumer surplus: $$\frac{13656}{2}*(19-12.17)=$46,635.24 $$
	2. Producer surplus: $$\frac{13656}{2}*(11.9-8)=$26,629.2$$
3. Tax revenue would just be $0.27*13656$ (that being the fee multiplied by the actual amount of deliveries that take place - it doesn't matter who bears the burden), which would be $3,687.12
   Deadweight loss is $$\frac{0.27}{2}*(14000-13656)=\$46.44$$
4. Consumer gives up more surplus - they give up $2,365 worth of economic surplus, while producers only give up $1,371 worth of surplus![[Econ in class shift spreadsheet.png]]
