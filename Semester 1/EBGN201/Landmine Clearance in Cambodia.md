1. 5 benefits of landmine clearance
	1. Reduce injuries
		1. $ can be assessed through medical fees (the value of a human life is a rather philosophical question)  
	2. More land available for agriculture
		1. Straight agricultural land value in Cambodia 
	3. Less live munitions floating around in publicly accessible hands
		1. Price that someone would have to pay to obtain those munitions through other means
	4. Goodwill with landmine remover 
		1. Somewhat arbitrary, but you could evaluate how willing the people whose landmines you are removing are to do work to assist in the effort, which would give a numerical sense of how much goodwill you have
	5. Access to resources previously blocked by landmines
		1. Value of these resources, including wells, minerals, etc
2. 5 costs of landmine clearance
	1. Purchasing cost of landmine-clearing equipment
		1. Straight monetary value of said equipment
	2. Paying people to clear landmines
		1. People may be willing to work for free, as this is humanitarian work, but they likely want wages
	3. Injuries in landmine clearing operations (accidents)
		1. Medical fees (again, value of a life is incalcuable)
	4. Permits and other regulations to operate in Cambodia
		1. Could be found by contacting local government bodies
	5. Training for landmines
		1. Some numerical cost - it depends on how intense landmine removal training is, what it entails, etc 
3. Anticipated problems
	1. Some things, like the value of human life or limb, are nearly impossible to accurately calculate, but you can make "estimates" for arguments sake. Goodwill and other nebulous quantities are also similarly difficult to quantify, but other things like the value of the land or resources on it are fairly straightforward to predict - even for the next several years. Permits and wages may vary depending on willingness to participate in what is in reality a humanitarian endeavor, which could end up eliminating those costs.
