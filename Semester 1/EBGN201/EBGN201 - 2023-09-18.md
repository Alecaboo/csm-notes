“If a price is not an equilibrium price, there is a tendency for price to move to its equilibrium level. Regardless of whether the price is too high or too low to begin with, the adjustment process will increase the quantity of the good traded.”

TRUE

This statement is true - an excellent answer was provided during the apartment example of Ch. 4's problem video; the equilbrium price of apartments is when rent is \$1,400, when the quantity demanded and supplied is equal. ![[Screenshot 2023-09-18 at 8.07.29 PM.png]]![[Screenshot 2023-09-18 at 8.10.25 PM.png]]

As is visible from both the table and the graph, no matter how you move along the axis, the amount of units sold increases - if supply is too high, there isn't enough demand, so reducing supply increases quantity sold. If supply is too low (demand too high), then there isn't enough supply, so increasing supply increases quantity sold.
