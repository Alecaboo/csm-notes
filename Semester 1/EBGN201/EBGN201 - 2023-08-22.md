Thursday attendance is optional

No more market analysis or canvas discussion boards! Yippee!!!!
 - ok maybe that was a lie, they're mostly dead, they're merged with data analysis
- Most things are graded on engagement rather than correctness
- Open note, multiple choice quzzes
- 10% of available achieve points will be dropped
- lowest achieve practice problem, lowest pre and post activities will be dropped
- Rounded to closest whole number
No final!
