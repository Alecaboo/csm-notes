1. An academic story that made you feel empowered and motivated
	1. Empowered academic story has to be in my digital electronics class senior year of high school, and in the last few months of that class we were working on various Arduino projects, and one of them was to make an optical encoder for a motor, which is shockingly difficult to do when working with a bunch of cardboard and the occasional 3d printed part. I had a partner who is actually a MechE at Fort Collins right now, and at that point I was planning to be an electrical engineering major, and it felt really empowering to be the only group in that class that actually got the project to work, thanks to learning how to do the Arduino code properly, with my partner doing the actual building, so it was super empowering to have a niche and apply it well. 
2. Think of an object you have in your room that tells a story about a nice memory with a family or friend
	1. I have a bookmark from a friend of mine who's an artist, and it's a drawing of my cat, and it's the fourth drawing of my cat that they've given me as a present, and its really touching both watching their art gro wand change over time, (as both have as people), yet we still have that friendship and that connection (less a memory, more a general idea, but it works)
3. What is a moment from your past that you wish you could change?
4. Song that resonates with a pivotal change in your life
5. Find a recent photo from your camera roll that tells a story about one of your values
	1.Picture of me holding my nephew, as stressful as college is, super important to  have fun, smile, enjoy, do all that fun stuff (short story but it works, I ran out of time)
